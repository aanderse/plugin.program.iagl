        <emu_comment>ReDump Sega Dreamcast list.[CR]The Dreamcast is a 128-bit video game console which was released by Sega in late 1998 in Japan and from September 1999 in other territories. It was the first entry in the sixth generation of video game consoles, preceding Sony's PlayStation 2, Microsoft's Xbox and the Nintendo GameCube. Dreamcast sales were positive during launch, but because of the strong pressure from rival PlayStation 2, Dreamcast sales decreased, and Sega finally discontinued the Dreamcast in March 2001 and withdrew entirely from the console hardware business, making it the company's final console.[CR]Developer:  Sega[CR]Manufacturer:  Sega[CR]CPU:  200 MHz Hitachi SH4 RISC[CR]Memory:  RAM 16 MB, GPU 8 MB[CR]Graphics:  100 MHz PowerVR2 CLX2[CR]Sound:  Yamaha AICA Sound Processor with a 32-Bit ARM7 RISC CPU[CR]Display:  640 x 480[CR]Media:  Disc[CR]Max Controllers:  4</emu_comment>

    <plot>The main purpose of the game is to make it to the finish line with the truck's cargo. Players are given a set amount of time, but can ram into special vans that will add three seconds to the timer. There are several characters to choose from, each with a unique truck and attributes.[CR]The game starts out in Key West and players travel across the United States, ending in San Francisco. After Stage 1, the game gives the player a choice of trailer. One trailer is harder to haul, but provides a bigger payoff while the other choice is easier to haul but provides a smaller payoff. Money is deducted from the total when the trailer is hit. Players can sound the truck's horn to make other cars on the road yield and slipstream behind large vehicles to gain a momentary speed boost.[CR]In addition to the time limit, players also compete with the "Lizard Tail", a rival trucker. Crossing the finish line before the Lizard Tail yields additional money. In between levels, players can park the truck in a mini game to earn more cash.</plot>

    <plot>21: Two One is a visual novel adventure game originally released for PC with adult content which is then ported to Dreamcast.[CR]Story [CR]After losing you mother to an illness, one day you decided to become a doctor and give your best to help other people not go through the same pain and ordeal. Your name is Takuya Kirishima, and you lived up to your expectations and became a skilled surgeon who can perform any surgery without a problem. But patients still die, and you may not be able to save them all... that brings the lack of confidence in you as a doctor and makes you question your goal to become a doctor. Seri Sakaki is a young nurse, and an old childhood friend of yours who is trying to help you deal with your limitations as a human. At such time, a murder occurs at the hospital and people start suffering from an unknown strange disease. The police investigation into it has been launched which yields many suspects and mysteries, and even more questions.[CR]Gameplay [CR]At its core, this is a visual novel adventure which determines the course of the story based on the choices you make. However, you can also set the mood of your character to trusting, normal, or suspicious, which will also affect the course of the game (quite similar to how it was done in Blade Runner). You will also be able to check the human relation chart to see connection between characters, as well as flow chart to see how the game story branched.</plot>

All in all, there are 24 areas in which to race, including various day/night and rain/sunshine variations. The game includes the standard championship, practice race, and two player modes.[CR]The Thunder series of games is unique in that the key to winning the race lies not in careful steering and braking, instead focusing more in finding the boost power-ups that lie around the tracks. Each boost icon adds a few seconds of time to your boost meter. The player then can press a boost button to increase the speed of the truck dramatically. Without using boost power-ups, the player has no chance of winning a race.</plot>

    <plot>90 minutes is a traditional action football game, featuring 7 leagues (England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, plus an assortment of clubs from around the world) and national teams. While there are no team licenses, most players feature real names and there's also a player and team editor, allowing to change name and number of players, who's in each national team, as well as creating teams from scratch, including its players.[CR]Gameplay follows the norms of the genre - A to pass, B to throw a high lob, X to shoot, Y to change players, with the triggers to perform modifiers (though passes and lob shots) and sprint, although these can all be changed in the options. The player can also assign special tactics to each direction on the d-pad to adapt quickly according to the flow of the game.[CR]Game modes include the usual - World Championship (based on the world cup), as well as national leagues and cups (as well as a customizable cup), with secret teams waiting to be unlocked by those who win them, exhibition and training. Options are also the usual on these kind of games - change half lenght (3,5 or 10 minutes), opponent level and game speed. At gametime, players can also choose the weather, time of day, and between 10 cameras. There are six stadiums to choose from, inspired by venues such as the old Wembley Stadium, the Nou Camp or the ArenA in Amsterdam.</plot>

    <plot>The story in this game consists of two main parts. First part focusing on school days and a group of students who set out on a hiking trip in Japanese Alps. However, the protagonist of the story, Yuuichi Takawashi, dies in an accident during mountain climbing. But because of the reincarnation process of the soul, Yuuichi's memories are played. But in order to playback the memories of the soul, it is necessary to have someone in your heart who you really want to meet. And so the story flashback to the memories of high-school when you were in third year and play until the day of your accident. Second part start with Yuuichi waking up in a hospital. But not is his own body, but rather in that of whomever you made heroine in the first part of the story. Your soul is sort-of possessing that person's body. You want to tell people you know that you are still alive somehow, but because you are not really you, it appears to be rather difficult feat to achieve. But it is a matter of time when the soul decides to merge, and because two souls cannot forever occupy the same body, the one that doesn't merge will disappear, and if Yuuichi's soul merges, he will continue to live on in this body.[CR]This visual novel plays just as typically, you read through the text with static backgrounds and non-animated characters and occasionally make choices that may propel the story toward a certain direction. There are also unlockable CG scenes and background music which can be viewed from gallery.[CR]Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 ports feature some new characters and scenarios which are not present in PC version.</plot>

    <plot>Air for Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 is a console port of an adult visual novel with the same name that was first released as Air as a PC title. This port, however, reduces adult rating and removed all the sexual content, but in turn adjusts the story to those removals and adds new graphics and scenes. Additionally, it includes full voice-acting for non-playable characters (NPCs).</plot>

    <plot>Alien Front Online is a Dreamcast video game originally released for the console in 2001.[CR]In the game, players use armored vehicles to fight tense battles staged in large, interactive arenas. Players could choose which side they wished to fight for, the aliens or the human defenders of Earth, and could also choose one of three different vehicles to combat with; each having its own advantages and disadvantages. Although Alien Front was fully playable for one person, it was primarily designed as an online game in which up to 8 players (up to 4 on each side) could battle it out. Players move around the arena attempting to blast each other with their weaponry, while also looking for power-ups that will enhance their ability to wreak massive destruction. Typically, the game was played for a set number of minutes, after which the team with the most kills would be declared the winners. Being killed while playing the game had no serious consequences (you simply respawned in a different part of the area you were in), but it did reflect on your win/loss score.</plot>

    <plot>Set on October 31, 2001. Edward Carnby's best friend and partner, Charles Fiske, has been found dead off the coast of Shadow Island, a mysterious island near the coast of Massachusetts. Carnby's investigation quickly leads him to Frederick Johnson, who informs him of Fiske's search for three ancient tablets with the ability to unlock an incredible and dangerous power. Johnson pleads with Carnby to take the place of Fiske and reopen the investigation in order to recover the tablets. Carnby accepts and makes it his mission to find Fiske's killer.

    <plot>The player takes a role of a young male assistant to the picture book writer who just went on a tour of Europe for an inspiration. You, on the other hand, desperately want to prove yourself in the area, but your inspiration is as dry as an empty well. So, you decide to take those three weeks of holidays to return to your hometown and give your best to come up with something solid or completely give up on wanting to become a picture book writer. Your hometown is a couple of hours from Tokyo by bullet train, though it is a rather rural area so it requires a switch to a more local train. Upon your arrival, you soon team up with Erina, an old friend of yours, and the two of you keep on exploring town, going places an meeting people. One night, walking alone in the woods, you get caught by the rain. Running to find a shelter, you stumble upon a small shrine. There, in front of your eyes, you see a flying silhouette which soon gets zapped by the thunder and falls down not far from where you are. Not sure what you saw really happened, you come outside and see a small fairy, down on the ground under the rain and with a wounded wing. You pick her up and tend to her wound. She quickly tests her fixed wings and flies away with a smile. As the morning comes, you look over town and has a sudden vision of an unknown place. Whatever happened to you granted you certain magical abilities you are not aware of.[CR]The game takes place in your hometown which represents reality, and a fantasy Layer world. In either world you can freely move around the map and talk to various characters you run along the way. Your hometown is split into six districts and different events and characters can be seen at different time of the day (morning, noon, evening, or night). When in Layer world, whenever important advance is being made, a battle scene which takes action on a separate combat arena will occur. The battle itself is real-time and consists of you trying to throw objects or use attacks against the boss. During adventure mode, when entering certain area from the map, the gameplay will resemble that of a regular visual novel with static backgrounds and character stills over it, varying in poses to emphasize their disposition. As dialogues are often short, dialogue choices are not used, but occasional actions you can perform are offered depending on the time and location.</plot>

Fleeing in whatever was available, humanity took to the stars in a desperate attempt to survive. Eons later, humans have split into 6 distinct groups who maintain a shaky alliance against the Armada. An Asteroids-like RPG, Armada was a sci-fi shooter that allowed 1-4 players to fly about the universe, fighting the enemy, performing missions and improving their ship. The player would gather credits to buy power-ups for their ship, allowing them to voyage deeper into enemy territory, blow up ever more powerful Armada, and perform missions of increasing importance and danger as the alliance fights not only for answers as to why the Armada attack, but for their very lives.</plot>

For instance, "enhanced" asteroids merely has a static backdrop, whereas "enhanced" warlords is a complete graphical overhaul with new colors.

    <plot>Welcome to the Gunship Elite. Sorry to rush you out of training school, but we have full confidence in your abilities. You are fighting for the future of our cultures and the heritage of your Arikhan warrior ancestry. The Alliance is being invaded by the Sektar and their bloodthirsty allies, the Morgoths. While for years we have held them, their numbers are wearing us down. We must take the offensive soon. That is where you come in...[CR]Bang! Gunship Elite is an action game where you shoot a lot of enemies all by yourself, in the vein of Wing Commander or Freespace, but with the action turned up and tactics turned down. There are many power-ups (dropped by dead enemies or left in space by your supply ships). The game is mouse driven with keyboard inputs for things like speed and weapon selection.</plot>

    <plot>A group of space pirates known as the Cosmo Gang is concocting an evil scheme, which involves smuggling rare fruits and using them for their own foul purposes. Two young mecha pilots, Riki and his sister Mami, board a giant mecha called Bangai-O, in order to confront the pirates in battle and foil their villainous plans.[CR]Bangai-O is a multi-directional shooter and a spiritual successor to Hover Attack. The player manoeuvres the titular mecha and shoots in eight directions. Two firing modes represent switching between the two pilots. Riki fires homing missiles, while Mami's shots bounce off walls. Enemies drop fruits upon defeat, which are equivalent to power-ups in other games. It is also possible to execute a special attack that consists of a burst of shots fired in all directions. Scoring successful combos (or increasing explosion count in the Dreamcast version) leads to higher-level power-ups.</plot>

    <plot>The game begins with Claire Redfield raiding an Umbrella Corporation facility in Paris in search of her brother, Chris Redfield. During the infiltration she is captured and imprisoned on Rockfort Island. Soon after arriving, a man named Rodrigo Juan Raval releases her from her cell, since she is not much of a threat considering the outbreak of the T-virus on Rockfort. Trying to escape from the contaminated island, Claire teams up with inmate Steve Burnside, at the same time being confronted with the island's commander Alfred Ashford. Meanwhile, Albert Wesker is on a mission of his own to retrieve a sample of the T-Veronica virus developed by Alfred's twin sister Alexia. His unit is also responsible for the outbreak of the T-virus on Rockfort Island.</plot>

    <plot>Black/Mtrix Advanced is an enhanced version of Black/Matrix. The game is set in a world which is controlled by demons, who have defeated the angels after a prolonged war. You control Abel, an angel who serves a female demon master (which you choose among several available characters in the beginning of the game). You and your master develop deep feelings for each other, but then your master disappears, and you decide to find her at all costs.[CR]The Dreamcast release comes on 2 GDs (instead of the single CD of the original), and features many anime-style cutscenes that were not included in the Saturn version. Also, the story cutscenes which happen after the battle don't use the isometric battle engine any more, but are viewed from first-person perspective, with character portraits occupying a large portion of the screen. Other differences include the addition of two scenarios (12 instead of the original 10), a new difficulty level (Easy), different art for character portraits, several changes in battle locations, and new plot details.</plot>

    <plot>Bomberman Online brings gamers the same addictive battles as in other Bomberman games in the form of online multiplayer puzzles. Players progress through different levels attempting to destroy their opponents by strategically planting bombs and running for cover. Each playing field is constructed out of both destructible and indestructible walls, and it's up to you to position bombs in the right place at the right time. The action gets frantic as alliances and rivalries are made and then broken. Intense battles unfold online when you connect to the Internet and play other Bomberman Online users in Internet battle mode. The new screen-scroll option displays a larger map, making it possible for numerous players to skillfully battle it out at the same time. Five new stages and four new ways to play add to the fun, creating an endless chain reaction of unique and dramatic battles!</plot>

    <plot>A futuristic sci-fi shooter in which you play a test pilot strapped to the brand new RAIN combat simulator which allows you to remotely control fighters as they immerse themselves in the midst of enemy territory.[CR]The game is a side-scrolling shooter in which you control your ship and try to survive the onslaught of enemy attacks while you attempt to clear the levels. Weapon upgrades are based on collectible power-ups, but the game mostly relies on a power bar that fills as you destroy enemies and which allows you to unleash your super weapon at the expense of decreased normal firepower. The game also features a unique "border" system which involves three separate routes through each stage. You select the default route at the start of a level and when your ship is destroyed you get knocked down to the next "border", which features alternate backgrounds and enemy patterns. Only if you get knocked off the last border you lose the game.[CR]Uses completely polygonal graphics and features single player arcade, remix and practice modes through 6 enemy-infested stages, the last of which has four unique variations.</plot>

The disk has data on all the pugilists from the Capcom vs Snk series. The VMU is used to be able to upload data to the game itself (if owned) and view Capcom producers super bouts.

    <plot>Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001, known in Japan as Capcom vs. SNK 2: Millionaire Fighting 2001 (kapukon basasu esuenukei 2 mirionea huaiteingu 2001 Kapukon basasu Esu-enu-kei Tsu: Mirionea Faitingu Tsu Sausando Wan?), is the sequel to the fighting game Capcom vs. SNK. It was originally released on NAOMI hardware in arcades. As in the original, players select a team of fighters from various Capcom and SNK games then fight other teams, winning each battle by defeating all the opponents from the other team.[CR]Aspects of the first game were tweaked, including the Ratio system. In contrast to the fixed system of the original, players can now freely select characters and assign each of them a number from one to four (or "Ratio") determining their relative strength, adding up to a maximum team ratio of four. Teams can now consist of a maximum of three characters, as opposed to four in the first game. Additional characters were added, including more characters from Capcom and SNK titles outside of the Street Fighter and King of Fighters series. The Groove system from Millennium Fight 2000 has been augmented to include four new systems of play based on various Capcom and SNK fighting games. In addition, the number of buttons has been increased from the Neo Geo standard of four to the six button system first seen in Capcom's Street Fighter.[CR]The game was initially ported to the Sega Dreamcast, followed by a version for the PlayStation 2. The GameCube and Xbox received an updated version titled Capcom vs. SNK 2 EO, with the "EO" referring to "Easy Operation", a game option intended for novices to the game. The PS2 version was later released on PlayStation Network in July 2013.[2]</plot>

    <plot>Seimadaisen" is a prequel to the first Castle Fantasia. The events of the game takes place 500 years before those of "Castle Fantasia", and tells the story of a two hundred year long religious war between the Inshiera Empire and the Ruushiera Republic. The Empire worships the God of Light and considers the republicans followers of an evil god. The army of the empire has seven holy squads, and you command a knight named Hyuui, the leader of one of them.[CR]"Seimadaisen" is a strategy RPG with erotic content. You fight on large battle screens, navigating your party in turn-based mode, attacking when enemies are in range. Enemies drop hearts when defeated, and collecting those hearts can heal you and raise your parameters. Between battles, there are parts in which you'll have conversations with girls and will be able to choose different answers, leading to different endings.</plot>

    <plot>his is a remake or "modernization" of the classic arcade shooter Centipede, originally released in arcades by Atari in 1980. This remake keeps some of the original game's shooter-style gameplay while mixing in more console-style exploration. Gameplay progresses through five "worlds": Weedom, Frostonia, Infernium, Enigma, and Evile. Players blast away at the classic centipedes, spiders, fleas, and scorpions while fighting new enemies like the mosquito, cockroach, and killer mushroom. A "classic" mode is also included, which allows players to play the classic game in a new "3D" isometric perspective.</plot>

As usual there is the balanced character (Johnny Rock), a weaker but faster one (Pamela Hewitt) and a slower but stronger one (Nicholas Woods).[CR]You can choose to play in one player mode, time attack or two player mode. The missions are broken up into small areas where you have to kill all enemies before moving on to the next area. Each mission ends with a boss character such as a giant insect or a Godzilla-like monster.[CR]Use the X, Y or B buttons to choose a weapon, press A to charge and shoot and aim with analog stick. There are different types of weapons that can be used on the different types of enemies. For example the single missiles for far away targets and torpedoes for underwater enemies.[CR]You can fire your weapon continuously, but this doesn't do as much damage compared to a fully charged shot. Charging each shot means you have to aim a little more carefully, but you'll especially need this in the later levels. You can dodge enemies with the L and R buttons.</plot>

    <plot>Cleopatra Fortune is a 1997 falling-block puzzle game featuring an anime Egyptian theme. Groups of stones and gems of different shapes fall from the top of a well. Gems can be cleared by enclosing them within a group of stones, and stones can be cleared by making complete rows from them. Blocks will fall when those under them are cleared, which can create chains for more points.[CR]The game includes three different play modes. First is a standard endless mode where play continues until the player is overwhelmed by the blocks. Second is a versus mode for two players. Last is a puzzle mode where the player is given a set field, a set sequence of drops, and a specific goal such as clearing all the gems or achieving a chain of a certain length. The puzzle mode has the player rescuing Cleopatra's friends who have been trapped in a pyramid by the evil Sphinx.[CR]Following the initial arcade release in 1997, a PlayStation version and a Sega Saturn version were released in Japan, followed later by the Dreamcast version in 2001. A PlayStation version was released in the USA and Europe in 2003. An arcade only sequel called Cleopatra Fortune Plus was released later in 2001, on the Sega NAOMI system. Both the Dreamcast port and this new sequel were created in association with Altron instead of Natsume.</plot>

    <plot>Confidential Mission is a light-gun compatible shooting game most easily likened to Sega's Virtua Cop series. You play as either Howard Gibson or Jean Clifford, both super-agents a la James Bond, and you are taken through scenarios shooting enemies and attempting to avoid civilian casualties.[CR]The game is a home version of the coin operated arcade machine, and is playable by one or two players. The game includes the popular features of the Virtua Cop series "Justice Shot" (in which you shoot an enemy's gun or gun arm instead of killing them) and the "Combo Shot" in which you can hit an enemy with up to three shots before they expire. The home version does include some mini-games and training modes that were not in the arcade version of the game.</plot>

    <plot>Confidential Mission is a light-gun compatible shooting game most easily likened to Sega's Virtua Cop series. You play as either Howard Gibson or Jean Clifford, both super-agents a la James Bond, and you are taken through scenarios shooting enemies and attempting to avoid civilian casualties.[CR]The game is a home version of the coin operated arcade machine, and is playable by one or two players. The game includes the popular features of the Virtua Cop series "Justice Shot" (in which you shoot an enemy's gun or gun arm instead of killing them) and the "Combo Shot" in which you can hit an enemy with up to three shots before they expire. The home version does include some mini-games and training modes that were not in the arcade version of the game.</plot>

    <plot>Cosmic Smash, originally released in the arcades, is a futuristic sports game, a mix of squash and Breakout.[CR]The player controls a semi-transparent human male in third-person view. The goal is to clear each level from a set of different blocks at the far end of the room within a given time limit. Additional time is given at the start of the next level depending on how well the player did. To clear the room, the player has to hit a ball with a racket at the correct angle. The ball bounces back from the blocks and walls. The blocks have different properties, for example, some have to be hit multiple times before they disappear, while others move around thus making them harder to hit.[CR]Besides the regular shot, the player can also perform a trick shot, which in combination with other moves gives extra points when successfully executed. At the end of each level, a map with branching paths is displayed, enabling the player to take different routes towards the end of the game.</plot>

The courses are largely set inside cities crowded with general traffic and pedestrians (which can't be run over, they dive away). The main goal is to bring as many customers as possible to their destination in time. Available customers are marked through circles and the colour represents the distance and the fare they offer. Green means long rides with plenty of money, and red ones are very short.</plot>

    <plot>D+Vine[Luv] (pronounced Divine Love) is a typical J-RPG, using a top-down perspective with a slightly isometric representation, which also utilizes visual novel segments for adventure elements. The player takes control of Hyde, an adventurous lad who has a knack for exploring dungeons in search of relics from the old world. One day, he arrives at the town called Arvil where he hears a rumor about a nearby unexplored cave. He heads there determined to find new relics, not minding the fact that noone's been there in ages and the place is probably infested with monsters. To his surprise, he doesn't discover and relic or a treasure, but instead, a mysterious girl named Yura. She has apparently lost her memory and can't remember anything but her name.[CR]Unlike the original PC (Windows) version released almost two years earlier, the Dreamcast port does not feature any adult content. A couple of years later, DVD PG Edition release came out which also includes adult content.</plot>

    <plot>It is Christmas of the year 2000. In the skies over Canada, Laura's plane has been hijacked by terrorists. The plane is filled with screams, shouts and fear as the hijackers terrorize the passengers and crew. In one of the seats a black-robed magician gazes into a crystal, chanting the phrase "Shadow, the final destroyer". Laura's compact begins to glow. A vision of a meteorite hurtling towards the Earth is reflected in the mirror. Suddenly the plane is struck by the same meteorite that appeared in the vision, and falls towards the frozen tundra below.[CR]In the middle of a raging blizzard, Laura opens her eyes to find herself inside a mountain cabin. She was saved by Kimberly, one of the passengers of the wrecked plane. Ten days have passed since the crash but Laura can remember nothing, not even her name. The door of the cabin opens and one of the terrorists enters. While Kimberly and Laura stare in horror, he transforms into a hideous monster. He is not the only one. Other crash survivors and locals have mutated into terrifying monstrosities and attacked people. Is there anyway to survive this living nightmare? At present it is shrouded in mystery.[CR]D-2 is a follow-up to D, though the two games are not directly connected to each other story-wise and also have significant differences in gameplay. D-2 combines a horror theme with shooter and role-playing elements. Exploring the vast snowy landscape and investigating the surroundings triggers extensive cutscenes that advance the narrative. The 3D engine allows free navigation around the world, though in-door locations have first-person navigation with limited movement. It is also possible to pilot a snowmobile, hunt for food, and capture photos.[CR]Horrifying monsters will attack randomly (or serve as boss fights at specific points of the plot), at which point the player is taken to a separate combat screen. Laura must dispatch of the enemies by rapidly shooting at them, in a way not dissimilar to the shooting sequences of Snatcher. Enemies can attack from different sides, so the player often has to turn around and quickly react to their attacks. Laura's default gun is weak, but uses unlimited ammunition; stronger guns with limited ammo can be found by exploring the surroundings. Laura receives experience points for defeating enemies and eventually levels up, becoming stronger and having her hit points increased.</plot>

    <plot>Momohime is a young girl who was found inside a giant peach as a child. She is traveling with her friends, hoping to learn more about where she came from. They have heard of another mysterious young girl named Nayotake who lives in the capital, and are heading there to see if there is any connection, but when they reach the capital they find it under attack by strange creatures! Just what is going on, and is there any connection between Momohime, Nayotake, and the mysterious creatures?[CR]Dancing Blade is an anime FMV game. The player simply watches each scene as it proceeds; the only interaction is occasionally selecting dialogue choices when prompted. Depending on the player's choices, they will reach one of four different endings. Once an ending is reached, the scenario leading to that ending can later be replayed without interruption. Any scene already viewed can also be freely revisited.</plot>

    <plot>A great leader was killed at the end of the 20th century. His name was Fame Douglas, and he was renowned as the sponsor of the legendary Dead or Alive World Combat Championship. Since his death, and in the absence of his charisma and leadership, the world has become chaotic. Yet something appears to be transpiring. Amid this chaos, it is announced that the "Dead or Alive Championship 2" will be held. However, Douglas's passing has taken with it the purpose and significance of the tournament. Even worse, the promoter of "Dead or Alive Championship 2", who is fond of conflicts and jealous of the string, is responsible for Douglas's death. The new promoter is more than a corrupt mastermind, but a man of pure evil. His involvement in the tournament has brought a sense of terror to the world, resulting in the infamous Tengu disaster that occurred at the end of the 20th century. The climax of the disaster is about to begin with a roaring battle.</plot>

    <plot>The player takes the role of a young boy who one day gets sucked into a fantasy world along with his friends after Dejiko's battle went all wrong. Upon arriving to a new world, you find yourself with a forest with Dejiko who seems to have sudden amnesia, and her typical frenzy-self is replaced with somewhat reluctant and shy persona.[CR]Originally released for PC (Windows) in 2001, the Dreamcast port got out later that same year. A couple of years later, the PlayStation 2 version got out under the title Di Gi Charat Fantasy Excellent with additional content.[CR]This visual novel features voice-acting as well as opening and in-game animated cut-scenes, but does not feature any unlockable content typical to most of visual novels. Also, the dialogue text cannot be hidden in order to see unobscured background image. The game does not feature a map of the new world you got sucked into, but lets you select from the list of locations you wish to visit from an overview of the new place you're in. Along with Dejiko, you'll visit new places, talk to new people, and hopefully her amnesia will come to pass and you'll find your way back home together.</plot>

    <plot>102 Dalmatians is a 3D platformer where you become a courageous Dalmatian puppy, who must rescue your family and friends from the clutches of Cruella De Vil. Disney's 102 Dalmatians: Puppies to the Rescue features beloved characters from 101 Dalmatians and new characters based on the upcoming 102 Dalmatians live action movie.[CR]The game follows the films' storyline loosely. The player can choose the role of one of two dalmatians, Oddball or Domino, who are out in the backyard looking for treasure. It is not long before the player realizes that a toy found buried in a park was made at one of Cruella de Vil's toy factories; this alludes to the fact that Cruella's toy sales are down, which ultimately leads to the problem in the storyline. Facing financial ruin from lack of sales, Cruella sets an evil plan in motion - to reprogram her toys to capture any pets in sight. Oddball and Domino are the only puppies in their family who have not been captured when they return from the park. Their parents, Dottie and Dipstick, set out to rescue their puppies, commanding Oddball and Domino to stay home and 'be good.' The puppies do not listen, and are soon out on their biggest adventure yet - to save their brothers and sisters, and their parents who are captured along the way.</plot>

    <plot>Disney's Dinosaur is a puzzle-adventure game based on the movie of the same name. You control three characters: Flia the pteradon, Aladar the Iguanadon and Zini the lemur, each of whom has different abilities. Flia can fly, Aladar can wade through water and crush rocks and Zini can fit through small spaces and pick things up. The game is seen from a top-down perspective, with the player switching characters on the fly. As in the movie, they must work together to reach the sacred nesting grounds for water and food after the rest of world dries up.[CR]Throughout the game, the characters' abilities are upgraded via an Intelligent Points System in an RPG-like addition. There are twelve levels divided into four acts.[CR]The game includes FMV clips from the movie and a dinosaur encyclopedia with information about real dinosaurs.</plot>

    <plot>Idol Star Seeker Remix is the first independent release from developer G.rev Ltd., the game differs quite a bit from the company's later games. It's a fast-paced puzzle game inspired by Minesweeper and is played on a hexagonal grid. The title was undertaken on a short development cycle and budget, but tried to compensate for these flaws through using the appeal of well-endowed anime girls in provocative poses.</plot>

    <plot>A console-exclusive re-packaging of two late graphical Zork franchise games: Return to Zork and the remake of Zork I -- together at last, despite vast differences in gameplay. What they have in common to deserve each others' company? A common bastardised Infocom heritage, and the fortune to be published for the same console platforms within a year or so of each other. No special packaging here, no "feelies" or other features appealing to fans and collectors (these target budget-minded new fans) -- the only thing that makes this a "collection" rather than a 2-for-1 grab from the discount bin is a cardboard sleeve that wraps around both regular-release jewel cases.</plot>

    <plot>At the dawn of the 30th Century, dolphins and humans had been together in a cross-species society for 500 years. Together, they had set out to explore space, offering peace and friendship to all who would welcome it. But space had its dangers; a violent species known as the Foe decided to conquer Earth. However, the dolphins and humans drove them to the brink of defeat, and so the Foe sought vengeance on Earth. The few caretaker dolphins who had been left behind on Earth were not entirely defenseless; they were protected by their creation called the Guardian--a gigantic, sentient being made of a crystalline substance which projected a forcefield over the entire planet. Undeterred, the Foe made suicide attacks on the field, searching for a weak point.</plot>

    <plot>At the dawn of the 30th Century, dolphins and humans had been together in a cross-species society for 500 years. Together, they had set out to explore space, offering peace and friendship to all who would welcome it. But space had its dangers; a violent species known as the Foe decided to conquer Earth. However, the dolphins and humans drove them to the brink of defeat, and so the Foe sought vengeance on Earth. The few caretaker dolphins who had been left behind on Earth were not entirely defenseless; they were protected by their creation called the Guardian--a gigantic, sentient being made of a crystalline substance which projected a forcefield over the entire planet. Undeterred, the Foe made suicide attacks on the field, searching for a weak point.</plot>

    <plot>Elemental Gimmick Gear is an action role-playing game for the Dreamcast console. Elemental Gimmick Gear uses hand-drawn art in an overhead view during exploration, then switches to 3D graphics during boss battles.[CR]In the world of Tokion, a dome-shaped ancient ruin was discovered inside a thick jungle. During excavation, an egg-shaped mecha was found inside the ruins containing a sleeping man. No matter how hard scientists tried, he would not wake up. He was taken to a laboratory along with the machine to be further studied.[CR]Upon analyzing the machine, they learned that it was over 5000 years old. They also could not find any form of power source. In time, the machine became known as "Elemental Gimmick Gear", or EGG for short. After extensive scientific analysis over a number of years, copies of the EGG were produced and used as vehicles.[CR]100 years later, the ruin suddenly became active, extending a multitude of tentacles into the ground. They spread all across the land, destroying anything in their way. With the tentacles came a thick layer of fog that surrounded the ruins, and people gave them the name Fogna.[CR]At the same time, the Sleeper who was discovered a century prior finally awoke. He had not aged a day since his discovery and had no memory of his past or his own name. Selen, who was with him as he woke, set him free without notifying the other scientists in the lab. She sent him to Fogna to begin searching for clues of what happened 5100 years ago, and to stop the tentacles' breeding.</plot>

    <plot>Originally released for PC (Windows) as an adult adventure game, the ports to Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 removed the adult content, included a new heroine and extended the story. You play as Ryouichi Katsuragi, a young doctor and a family physician summoned to tend to an old man living in a huge mansion on the island in Italy. Upon arriving to the island in a helicopter, the game switches to 3rd-person perspective where you can freely explore the mansion and its surroundings and interact with various characters, including the mansion maids which act as heroines in this story. During 1st-person perspective mode, the game plays like a typical visual novel where you converse with other characters which are non-animated but feature voice-acting. The player choices during dialogues affect the story and key choices branch it toward a different ending. The bonus features which are accessible from the main menu are music player and unlockable heroine gallery.</plot>

    <plot>It is the same place. But it is different time. The events of the past will influence the present and change the future. A mysterious item that was hidden thousand years ago will play an important role in the events of today and tomorrow...[CR]1200 BC. Total obedience is what the God demands from the people. Humans have no free will, but they believe that their obedience will bring them reward. The protagonist in this time period is the "flame priest" Ales who serves the God. 200X AD - many good and evil powers are present in the world of our time, but the treasure hunter Kasumi Shindou is only interested in one thing - to find a treasure and become rich, and nothing and nobody will stop him. In the future, 13800 AD, the skies have became black, the oceans are red, and the earth is on the verge of a disaster - Sui, the last descendant of a royal dynasty, and her friends decide to undertake something to change the reality.[CR]Exodus Guilty is a visual novel featuring the so-called "Multitime Zapping System", which allows you to play as Ales, Kasumi, and Sui in their respective time periods, switching between them when necessary. You have to gather various items and to coordinate your actions in the past so that the future will be changed. The gameplay relies largely on dialogues (at certain points you are able to choose one of several available answers). You can also navigate your characters from first-person perspective (pressing arrows that point to different directions). You also have a party - people who join the main protagonists and help them in their quests.[CR]The Dreamcast release, Exodus Guilty Neos, adds full voice acting but is otherwise identical in content.</plot>

    <plot>F355 Challenge is a racing simulation arcade video game based on the actual race car and Ferrari event. It was developed by the AM2 division of Sega for the Sega Naomi Multiboard arcade system board under the direction of Yu Suzuki, and was later ported to the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 video game consoles under the names F355 Challenge: Passione Rossa and Ferrari F355 Challenge respectively for both American and European releases. The only model of car featured in the game is the Ferrari F355 Challenge model. The game was considered the most accurate simulation of the F355 possible up until that time.[CR]Some versions of the arcade cabinet are noteworthy for having three screens, allowing the player to look through the side windows as they would in a real car. The three-screen cabinet version also features an H-shaped gear stick and three foot pedals, and presents a tough challenge to any player who decides to use them. The cabinet itself is composed of four NAOMI units: one for each of the three screens and one to sync them all. The game also allows the player to use an automatic transmission or paddle-shift the gears. It also uses a real-time "Magic Weather" system similar to Shenmue. The Dreamcast version has link cable play for direct competition, however as of Jan. 2006, the online servers for F355 Challenge are now offline, and the website has gone offline.[CR]The game features an original soundtrack featuring Genki Hitomi and Minoru Niihara that mimics the style of 1980s hard rock/heavy metal which is integrated into a radio station format during gameplay. The radio DJ (and the announcer) goes by the name of Alan J (the Voice, born 14 July 1959).[CR]Yu Suzuki is a keen Ferrari enthusiast who allegedly used data from his own Ferrari 355 at certain tracks to implant in the game during its development.</plot>

    <plot>Fighting Vipers 2 is a 3D fighting video game developed by Sega AM2 and published by Sega for their Model 3 arcade board in 1998, and later ported to the Dreamcast in 2001. It is the sequel to the 1995 game Fighting Vipers.[CR]Along with the original cast of the first game, Fighting Vipers 2 introduced Emi, a computer geek who fights with a self-developed mecha armor, and Charlie, a BMX rider. New unlockable characters included Del Sol (a Mexican wrestler with a Sun mask), and Kuhn (a copycat character with various movesets from all the other original characters similar to Virtua Fighter's Dural.[CR]The game was planned for a U.S. release but was later cancelled.[CR]The game was praised for being a perfect Dreamcast port of the original Model 3 Arcade game (unlike Virtua Fighter 3tb which was a loose port), however the developers did not include any additional extras for this release, making it a straight port.</plot>

    <plot>A great leader was killed at the end of the 20th century. His name was Fame Douglas, and he was renowned as the sponsor of the legendary Dead or Alive World Combat Championship. Since his death, and in the absence of his charisma and leadership, the world has become chaotic. Yet something appears to be transpiring. Amid this chaos, it is announced that the "Dead or Alive Championship 2" will be held. However, Douglas's passing has taken with it the purpose and significance of the tournament. Even worse, the promoter of "Dead or Alive Championship 2", who is fond of conflicts and jealous of the string, is responsible for Douglas's death. The new promoter is more than a corrupt mastermind, but a man of pure evil. His involvement in the tournament has brought a sense of terror to the world, resulting in the infamous Tengu disaster that occurred at the end of the 20th century. The climax of the disaster is about to begin with a roaring battle.</plot>

    <plot>Giant Killers is a text-based football management game, and as such the focus of the game is on the statistics and not on the action.[CR]Based on the 1999 UK season, the game allows the player to take control of any team in the UK's Premier league, Divisions One, Two or Three, or the Conference league. The game has three levels of difficulty. In the easy level the player's club has a wealthy benefactor who makes PS25m available, in the medium setting PS25m is still available, but two other clubs in the league also receive the same cash injection. In the hard mode there is no extra cash available.[CR]Having started the game and selected a team, the player is presented with the game's main menu. The options here allow the player to access a quick overview of the club's status, fixtures, results and league tables. The main menu also allows the manager to access the transfer market, where players can be bought and sold, and the manager's diary, where messages, such as the success or failure of a transfer bid, are received. It is through the manager's diary that game-time is advanced through to the day of the next match.[CR]On match day the player selects their team from the available squad, and decides the formation to be used and tactics - long ball, direct or passing - for the upcoming match. The game offers many standard formations as well as offering the player the chance to create their own.[CR]Having decided how the game is to be played, the player starts the match. As this is a management game, there is no game play video to watch; instead the player receives match highlights as though on a teleprompter. At any time during the game the player can pause the match and change the team's tactics and / or make a substitution.[CR]At the end of the match the player can view a range of stats on individual performance e.t.c.[CR]The game is entirely mouse controlled, though a keyboard is required when entering names for save games.</plot>

    <plot>The diabolical Skorne has scattered the planet's powerful rune stones throughout the world so that nobody can use their powers to challenge his evil rule. Pick your character either the Warrior, Wizard, Valkyrie, or Archer and work with your party as you go on the ultimate manhunt. Fight your way through castles, deserts, temples, and forests and upgrade your weapons and powers as you collect money and experience. The action is fast and furious, but if you don't fight smart you'll find yourself right back where you started. But it'll take more than a powerful punch to get far, as there are a host of puzzles that will challenge your mind and might mean the difference between success and failure. Can you find the rune stones and use them to your advantage? It may be the only way to defeat Skorne, so gather your party and head into the great unknown on the most important journey of your life.</plot>

Holding the button activates the Reflect Force. The B button fires a bomb from a limited stock to become temporarily invincible. Power-ups can be collected to increase the bomb and life stock or enhance the main gun's fire power.[CR]Scoring works by using the Reflect Force to repel enemy shots. Once the shots hit an enemy, medals appear in their place. When these are collected, the score multiplier increases.</plot>

    <plot>Lie, cheat, and steal your way through three districts of a huge city in the follow-up to Grand Theft Auto. Earn the respect of 7 different gangs as you demolish the town in your attempt to make lots of cash.[CR]The game takes place at an undisclosed time in the near future. Unlike the first game which featured three different cities, Grand Theft Auto 2 only features a single town, but it's divided in three districts which are unlocked one at a time: downtown, residential and industrial. Like in the original the player goes around answering phones to initiate various missions. The game uses an overhead camera in a 3D landscape and allows the player to freely explore the city and steal any vehicle the player sets his or her eyes on. To unlock new districts the player must reach a certain score which is done by committing crimes and finishing missions.[CR]Because the game now features multiple criminal gangs, the player must choose allegiances. Performing missions for one gang, will decrease the player's reputation for another. When the player commits crimes he also becomes wanted by the local police, but as more crimes are committed without shaking the police, they will give way for first SWAT Teams, then Special Agents and finally the army.[CR]New features include the ability to save at the church, when donating enough money, and various side missions, such as becoming a taxi driver to ear money. There are also many new cars with weapons attached such as a firetruck with a flamethrower and a car with machine guns.</plot>

    <plot>Grauen no Torikago Kapitel 1: Keiyaku (gurauennoNiao Long Kapitel 1 [Qi Yue ] ) is not a game, but the first chapter of an horror movie.[CR]This movie is rather unusual:[CR]1) It was sold exclusively through the Dreamcast Direct online service.[CR]2) It's divided into 365 episodes on 6 discs. Each episode lasts one minute.[CR]3) It was impossible to watch all the episodes at once - they opened gradually. From October 1, 1999 to October 2000, it was necessary to connect Dreamcast to the Internet every day and download special save files on the VMU that opened new episodes.[CR]The servers went offline shortly after. Now it is necessary to use a special VMU save or directly extract the videos of the gdi disc image to watch the film.[CR]The sequels of Grauen no Torikago were only available to consumers who had finished previous chapters, making later entries exceedingly rare.[CR]The main character of Grauen no Torikago is a 16-year-old schoolgirl named Nao Tsunoda. Recently, she decided to start living separately from her parents - and moved to Tokyo's Grauenheim apartment complex. But one day, Nao's life turns into a nightmare when she suddenly discovers the headless corpse of her neighbor (Erica Shimizu) on the roof of the house.[CR]And having entered a neighbor's apartment, Nao sees an even more eerie scene: music from the opera Faust plays in the room, and Erica's severed head hangs from the ceiling and makes strange howling sounds! The killer snapped the girl's head and connected it through a hose to the gas pipe so that the head "sang" to the music from the CD player ... But why did the killer do it? Just out of a desire to mock the corpse, or is there a secret meaning in its actions?[CR]Soon the chain of brutal murder continues - and it becomes clear that a psychopath is hunting the inhabitants of Grauenheim. Moreover, it not only kills people, but also disfigures their corpses so that they carry a certain symbolism in themselves. Will our heroine be able to unravel this symbolism and reveal the identity of the killer, or is she destined to become another victim of a maniac?</plot>

    <plot>Grauen no Torikago Kapitel 1: Keiyaku (gurauennoNiao Long Kapitel 1 [Qi Yue ] ) is not a game, but the first chapter of an horror movie.[CR]This movie is rather unusual:[CR]1) It was sold exclusively through the Dreamcast Direct online service.[CR]2) It's divided into 365 episodes on 6 discs. Each episode lasts one minute.[CR]3) It was impossible to watch all the episodes at once - they opened gradually. From October 1, 1999 to October 2000, it was necessary to connect Dreamcast to the Internet every day and download special save files on the VMU that opened new episodes.[CR]The servers went offline shortly after. Now it is necessary to use a special VMU save or directly extract the videos of the gdi disc image to watch the film.[CR]The sequels of Grauen no Torikago were only available to consumers who had finished previous chapters, making later entries exceedingly rare.[CR]The main character of Grauen no Torikago is a 16-year-old schoolgirl named Nao Tsunoda. Recently, she decided to start living separately from her parents - and moved to Tokyo's Grauenheim apartment complex. But one day, Nao's life turns into a nightmare when she suddenly discovers the headless corpse of her neighbor (Erica Shimizu) on the roof of the house.[CR]And having entered a neighbor's apartment, Nao sees an even more eerie scene: music from the opera Faust plays in the room, and Erica's severed head hangs from the ceiling and makes strange howling sounds! The killer snapped the girl's head and connected it through a hose to the gas pipe so that the head "sang" to the music from the CD player ... But why did the killer do it? Just out of a desire to mock the corpse, or is there a secret meaning in its actions?[CR]Soon the chain of brutal murder continues - and it becomes clear that a psychopath is hunting the inhabitants of Grauenheim. Moreover, it not only kills people, but also disfigures their corpses so that they carry a certain symbolism in themselves. Will our heroine be able to unravel this symbolism and reveal the identity of the killer, or is she destined to become another victim of a maniac?</plot>

    <plot>Gundam Side Story 0079: Rise from the Ashes is a mech combat simulation set in the Gundam universe. Created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the franchise, it presents an original story set during the One Year War between the Earth Federation and Zeon, parallel to the events of the first Gundam TV series. It takes place in Australia and stars the mobile suit team White Dingo, a guerrilla combat unit supporting the main forces of a Federation counteroffensive against the Zeonic forces.[CR]The player controls Lt. Rayer, who along with his team mates Leung, Mike and Anita must fight Zeon in nine missions. The squad of three mobile suits (Anita controls the OASIS hover truck) must be outfitted by choosing suits, weapons, and shields. Two suits are available from the start: RGM-79 and RGC-80, with the RGC more heavily armed and armored at the cost of reduced mobility.[CR]Missions are seen from a first-person cockpit perspective, but also employ in-engine cutscenes to show plot developments. Mission objectives usually include the destruction of a specific enemy unit or structure, but goals can change mid-mission. Leung and Mike fight on their own but can also be given specific orders, including movement and search patterns, attacking specific enemies or defending friendly units. They can be given preferences for long- mid- or close-range combat. Anita's OASIS truck cannot attack or defend, but can be used to detect enemies on the map through a special radar scan. Enemies include all sorts of ground soldiers, tanks, aircraft and of course mobile suits as seen in the TV show, including Zakus, Goufs and Gelgoogs.</plot>

    <plot>Gundam Side Story 0079: Rise from the Ashes is a mech combat simulation set in the Gundam universe. Created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the franchise, it presents an original story set during the One Year War between the Earth Federation and Zeon, parallel to the events of the first Gundam TV series. It takes place in Australia and stars the mobile suit team White Dingo, a guerrilla combat unit supporting the main forces of a Federation counteroffensive against the Zeonic forces.[CR]The player controls Lt. Rayer, who along with his team mates Leung, Mike and Anita must fight Zeon in nine missions. The squad of three mobile suits (Anita controls the OASIS hover truck) must be outfitted by choosing suits, weapons, and shields. Two suits are available from the start: RGM-79 and RGC-80, with the RGC more heavily armed and armored at the cost of reduced mobility.[CR]Missions are seen from a first-person cockpit perspective, but also employ in-engine cutscenes to show plot developments. Mission objectives usually include the destruction of a specific enemy unit or structure, but goals can change mid-mission. Leung and Mike fight on their own but can also be given specific orders, including movement and search patterns, attacking specific enemies or defending friendly units. They can be given preferences for long- mid- or close-range combat. Anita's OASIS truck cannot attack or defend, but can be used to detect enemies on the map through a special radar scan. Enemies include all sorts of ground soldiers, tanks, aircraft and of course mobile suits as seen in the TV show, including Zakus, Goufs and Gelgoogs.</plot>

    <plot>Welcome to the future. In the early 21st century, gang warfare and crime have lead to the creation of privatised law enforcement. The Anti-Crime Network (ACN) employs bounty hunters known as 'Headhunters' to track down the most wanted criminals, using combat skills and high-tech weaponry. You are Jack Wade, an ex-cop turned Headhunter. At the beginning of the game you find yourself strapped to an operating table and manage to escape. After passing out in an alley, you awake in hospital from a coma. With your license revoked and few memories, you are hired by Angela Stern, to find her fathers murderer. Maybe you'll even find out what happened to yourself if you can stay alive long enough... Headhunter is an action adventure viewed from over the shoulder. In the top right of the screen you have a radar which will track your movements and those of the enemy. Jack has a few moves at his disposal. He can duck and roll, push, pull and climb objects as well as flatten himself up against a wall. Using this technique he can peek around corners for a better view of the action, and then attack from this position, using the wall as protection. Between levels, Jack has a motorcycle that he uses to transport himself between various locations in the city according to the clues he receives. You will need to earn skill points however before you can arrive at a destination. Certain parts of the city are unavailable until you have gained the appropriate Headhunter license. As you have no recollection of your past, you have to take a series of licenses that will grant you access to greater parts of the city, weaponry and gadgets. These are taken in a VR simulator known as the Law Enforcement Intelligence and Licence Approval (LEILA). At various times in the game you will need to go to the LEILA building and upgrade your licence by practising your combat, stealth and driving skills.</plot>

    <plot>The game revolves around a promise you made with a girl as a young boy, to meet each other when you grow older, and a secret that has been kept for all these years. While there are many heroines included, this game's premise is more that of a mystery novel than a romance. The story takes place in present time during your reunion with your childhood friends, as well as during past time during your childhood days.[CR]The art style in this game is rather unique in comparison to typical visual novel anime art style. The background art uses somewhat a mix of a life-like re-touched images and anime drawings. While characters use voice-acting in this Dreamcast exclusive visual novel, the animation is non-existent during dialogues. The bonus content features unlockable heroine albums which can be accessed via main menu.</plot>

    <plot>Hundred Swords is a fantasy real-time strategy game with 3D graphics.[CR]Boy prince loves girl princess, but an evil invader spoils the fun by, well, invading. Prince Larf thus battles his way back to his sweetheart. The 3D real-time strategy game was originally created for Sega's Japanese fiber optic service net@, then ported to the Dreamcast but never released outside of Japan. Ported once more to the PC, Hundred Swords finally reached North America and Europe.[CR]Single soldiers? Don't bother. You control complete units of five to 20 men gathering round a commander. Micro-management is reduced, instead it's paper, scissors, stone: cavalry is strong against mages, mages are strong against infantry, and so on. Officers can recruit new soldiers in barracks, as long as your mines supply enough of two resources. Your tasks on the small 3D playfields vary from flight to defence to all-out attack, sometimes with time limits. Depending on your success, you are awarded shells, magical items that can be equipped to the commanders and activated in battle for a short-term benefit. Commanders will also gain experience, making them tougher and able to control more soldiers.[CR]In the single-player campaign, anime stills and 3D cut-scenes tell the story of prince Larf and his gang. When the adventure's through, a mission mode let's you play single battles with units not available in the main storyline. Up to four players can also link together via network or internet and test their skill against each other.</plot>

    <plot>Several years ago in the small island nation of Horai, the leader of the nation, Tenro Horai, discovered the Ubusunagami Okinokai--the Power of the Gods. This energy emanated from an object she dug up from deep underground and granted her unimaginable powers. Soon after, Tenro and her followers, who called themselves "The Divine Ones", began conquering nations one after another. "The Chosen People" carried out these conquests in "the name of peace".[CR]Meanwhile, a freedom federation called Tenkaku emerged to challenge Horai. Using fighter planes called Hitekkai, they fought with the hope of freeing the world from the grips of the Horai - but all their efforts were in vain. They were no match for the Horai and were eventually almost completely wiped out. Miraculously, however, one young man survived. His name was Shinra (Sen Luo ?).[CR]Shot down near a remote village called Ikaruga, inhabited by elderly people who had been exiled by the Horai's conquests, Shinra was dragged from the wreckage and nursed back to health. Shinra regained his health and pledged to defeat the Horai, and the villagers entrusted him with a fighter plane that they had built themselves, called the Ikaruga.[CR]The Ikaruga was no ordinary plane, designed by former engineering genius Amanai (Tian Nei ?) with the help of Kazamori (Feng Shou ?) and the village leaders. Hidden in a secret underground bunker and launched via the transportation device called the "Sword of Acala", it is the first fighter built that integrates both energy polarities, and is capable of successfully switching between the two.</plot>

    <plot>Incoming aliens! Incoming aliens! They've already attacked the international moonbase, and they may already have a base in the Arctic! Earth is building a huge tracking station as first part of the counterattack, but now you detect incoming aliens and they don't look friendly! Defend your base against the initial incursion by manning turret, tank, helicopter, harrier jet, and even captured alien fighter as you battle the aliens in various continents, and eventually lead the counterattack on the moon![CR]Incoming is a 3D shooter with plenty of action. In arcade mode, you can play it as a straight shooter. Some missions have you manning an immobile turret where you simply aim at the sky and engage incoming bogeys. Other missions can have you control a ground hovertank engaging enemy ground threats. Yet other missions will have you control a helicopter, a Harrier jumpjet, and even a captured alien fighter. There are also an "action" mode and "action-tactics" mode, where you are given some limited control of other friendly units.</plot>

    <plot>Blending the stealth, RTS, and RPG genres, Industrial Spy has the player leading a team of superspies (Espion Agents, part of the Blitzstrahl corporation) infiltrating various locales like museums, a military installation, and even a German-style castle full of traps. Each of the agents has his own specialties, like computer hacking, rollerblading, handguns, etc.[CR]Gameplay is like a regular real-time strategy game, with the player acting in the role of commander without taking a direct hand in anything. Give the agents orders and try to keep an eye on all of them as they carry them out. Each agent's skills can be upgraded after missions. Keep them out of sight of guards, spring traps on them, or engage them in hand-to-hand or ranged combat.</plot>

    <plot>Iron Aces is fictional World War 2 flight simulator. What that "fictional" means is that great liberties have been taken with the historical accuracy of the world and events. The most obvious point is that although most planes come from real World War 2 aircraft, the theatre of operations is a bit unique; The four major sides to the conflict (American, British, German, Japanese) are all fighting one another over a group of islands somewhere in the Pacific. Thus each of these nations is represented in close proximity and in direct conflict to one another.[CR]The gameplay takes place over a series of single-player flight missions in which your American pilot will fight against the Axis forces and ally with the British. The majority of the missions take place in the air against other aerial targets.</plot>

    <plot>Hikaru is a normal Japanese teenager, who goes to the prestigious Izumo academy. Lately he has been seeing dreams: a mysterious woman appears, trying to tell him something. One day he accidentally touches a mirror in an abandoned building near the school. At this moment, the school becomes infested with monsters. Hikaru and his sister have no choice but to fight the monsters and to find out the connection to the hero's mysterious dreams.[CR]Izumo is a standard Japanese RPG with extensive portions of "digital novel", in which the player views events displayed as anime-style still shots, occasionally making a decision. The main part of the gameplay - RPG - consists of navigating the party of heroes through the dungeon and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from isometric perspective. The camera can be rotated 180 degrees during exploration. The characters have elemental affinities and can learn various types of elemental magic.</plot>

    <plot>In the 21st century, the Tokyoto city government bans kids from expressing themselves in any way. Only three things keep their spirits alive: Overdriver magnetic-motor skates, graffiti, and a pirate-radio broadcast that's called Jet Grind Radio. Explore and, uh, decorate three fully interactive worlds in which traffic moves at real time and pedestrians wander the streets. Watch out for police who'll want to nab you for breaking the law, and rival crews that want to deface your artwork. The "Cartoon Dimension" art style gives the game the appearance of a 2-D comic, but the characters move through it in complete 3-D. Animations run at 30 frames per second. Ten characters are available at the outset, each of which has its own style and abilities.</plot>

    <plot>Licensed by snooker player Jimmy White, this game is a simulation of not only the British game of snooker, but also of the three main variations of pool.[CR]The game is viewed in detailed 3D, allowing you to rotate the table at all angles, either from overhead or using the cue position as a base. Taking a shot involves setting the exact pace and spin of it, and considering what each contact will do to the position of the cue ball, and any balls you may wish to pot afterwards. In the snooker mode playing accurate 'safety' shots (to prevent your opponent scoring) becomes important as well).[CR]In each mode there are 10 computer opponents, and matches can consist of up to 9 frames. A trick-shot editor is also included, allowing you to practice shots and set up challenges. Replays and an undo mode are also included.</plot>

    <plot>July is a mystery adventure game that follows the story of two young men, Makoto Tanimura (19-year old) and Joshua (29-year old) who set on a quest to uncover the mystery behind a bombing that took place several years ago. The story of the two play separately in their own chapters and can be progressed in any order, one chapter at the time. While their stories start separately, their paths cross when they uncover the truth behind the bombing and how it all ties to a secret corporation known as NAX.[CR]July is more of a visual novel where player advances through dialogues and choices, and travels to different locations, than typical adventure with clickable objects and inventory items. The map is a big part of interface and chooses many locations that player can visit as events are triggered by visiting the right place at the right time. The game uses anime style character art with pre-rendered backgrounds and occasional pre-rendered animated cut-scenes. There is no voice-acting, however, neither for player characters nor for NPCs.</plot>

This city is constructed with the help of the most modern industry, based on an operation system that is capable to create the most progressive form of urban life - the so-called "intelligent city". But something goes wrong. It seems like a virus that creates a fire substance inside of human beings' bodies. The disease soon became known under the name "Spontaneous Human Combustion". Particularly one district of the newly built Izanami City seems suspicious. Kento Rando, a high school student and an apprentice detective, is given a mission to investigate the mysterious case. Seigai High School is going to be the principal area of investigation. Needless to say that in order to solve the case, Kento will have to find the best strategy talking to the beautiful high school female students...[CR]Kaen Seibo is a Japanese-style adventure which relies largely on conversations and the choices you make during them. However, the game also contains elements of Western-style adventuring. There are items that must be found, picked up and used at appropriate moments. There are areas where you can move through a 3D-like environment, viewing it from first-person perspective. During the dialogues, you also have commands that are accessible through a menu. There are also segments with a time limit.</plot>

    <plot>A kangaroo named Kao was playing with his friends in his native Australia, when suddenly evil hunters appeared, put him in a cage, and took him away. They didn't know that Kao was quite proficient in the art of boxing, so freeing himself from the trap wasn't particularly hard. However, Kao finds himself far away from home, and must fight and hop his way back.[CR]Kao the Kangaroo is a 3D platform action game. The gameplay adheres to the jump-and-run style, Kao having to rapidly traverse levels full of traps and enemies. His basic attack is a simple punch; he can also side-step and swing his tail at the enemies. Power-ups scattered through the stages include coins, a certain amount of which will increase Kao's life points; hearts to replenish his health; boxing gloves, which act as homing projectile attacks; and turbo boosts, which make Kao move faster.</plot>

    <plot>A kangaroo named Kao was playing with his friends in his native Australia, when suddenly evil hunters appeared, put him in a cage, and took him away. They didn't know that Kao was quite proficient in the art of boxing, so freeing himself from the trap wasn't particularly hard. However, Kao finds himself far away from home, and must fight and hop his way back.[CR]Kao the Kangaroo is a 3D platform action game. The gameplay adheres to the jump-and-run style, Kao having to rapidly traverse levels full of traps and enemies. His basic attack is a simple punch; he can also side-step and swing his tail at the enemies. Power-ups scattered through the stages include coins, a certain amount of which will increase Kao's life points; hearts to replenish his health; boxing gloves, which act as homing projectile attacks; and turbo boosts, which make Kao move faster.</plot>

    <plot>In this unique vertically-scrolling shooter you take the role of a mysterious girl named Karous, who commands a tiny fighter ship and attempts to destroy an evil armada bent on world domination.[CR]The game plays as your average vertical-scrolling shooter, in which you must clear several stages by destroying all incoming enemies and surviving their onslaught. A unique addition to Karous, is that you don't collect weapons by power-ups, but instead upgrade each of your basic weapons (gun, sword and shield) depending on their use thanks to a basic experience module, with increased power and features at later levels (multiple shots, bullet reflection, etc.)[CR]The game uses cel-shaded polygonal graphics with a distinct black and white look.</plot>

    <plot>Kidou Senshi Gundam: Giren no Yabou is a series of turn-based strategy games developed and published by Bandai, based on the popular Mobile Suit Gundam franchise. It takes its gameplay style from the SD Gundam series and adds political and military management to the One Year War. The title is derived from that of Nobunaga's Ambition, although the English title uses a different translation for the word yabou.[CR]Giren no Yabou: Zeon no Keifu introduces a more complex political system. The player can now create ceasefires and treaties, and the military system supports mobile suit upgrading and customization. The map system is also updated.[CR]Zeon no Keifu expands beyond the One Year War setting and into Zeta-era conflicts, introducing new factions to: AEUG, two factions of the Titans (one under Jamitov and one under Scirocco), Axis Zeon, Neo Zeon, Delaz Fleet. It also includes two versions of the Zeon forces: Kycillia's "Legitimate Zeon" and Garma's "Zeon Reborn".</plot>

    <plot>Lack of Love (or L.O.L.) can be considered a genre-defying game, though it has strong elements of adventure (problem-solving based on exploration) and RPG (character growth and management). The game's unusual premise is the evolution of an alien being. In the beginning the player takes control of a tiny, newborn creature. The alien world is harsh, so the "hero" has to constantly improve, learn new things and avoid being eaten by other animals. To make the new life even harder, an alien robot race just discovered the planet and starts colonizing it. Surviving is obviously not easy...[CR]The game is played from a third-person perspective with pre-rendered backgrounds. Since the protagonist is an animal, the game doesn't have any ingame texts; for solving riddles the player is totally dependent on experimentation and careful observation of the environment. To reach the next state of evolution the player will also need to help other beings - as a reward they will give the controlled creature energy balls or new abilities required for further progress.[CR]Besides the usual actions like attacking, biting, and talking (or, better to say, communicating) the creature can perform somewhat strange actions such as sleeping and urinating, which are essential to the gameplay.</plot>

    <plot>Langrisser Millennium is yet another installment of the long-running Japanese strategy RPG series. You control five main characters: Taji, a young boy whom was chosen as the ruler of the country Salem; Nei Lee Sun, the ruler of Chin, who helps Taji when he gets involved in a war; Masariva, a half-beast and a former slave who became a queen, but preferred the life of a wanderer; Rumaty Marf, the queen of the country Misla, on a quest for an angel who appeared in her dream; and Saryune, the ruler of Vidern, whose only desire is power. Those five rulers meet each other, when they get involved in a war with hostile countries. However, soon they learn a greater evil has appeared in the world - they must reach a faraway island to prevent the reincarnation of an evil god...[CR]The gameplay of Langrisser Millennium is divided into "Map Mode" and "Battle Mode". In map mode, you move your characters over a map, trying to reach enemy fortresses and to prevent the enemy to reach yours. Everything happens in real time: if you do nothing, the enemy will come and conquer your country. Once in battle mode, you control several teams. You only assign actions to the team leaders, while others fight automatically in round-based strategy combat.</plot>

    <plot>Soul Reaver is a third-person perspective action game with puzzle-solving and some platforming elements. The game follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player views the environments from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. He can also shift through the "material" world into the "spectral" realm at will, but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate.</plot>

The premise is that, as a street racer, the player must impress other drivers with quick but stylish driving in a series of challenges. These challenges are in sets of ten (called Chapters - there are 25 in total), with completion of all challenges opening the next chapter (assuming the player has enough Kudos, see below) and unlocking a new car.

    <plot>With exciting first-person sword combat and an engaging storyline with multiple endings, Maken X is one of the most unusual action- adventure games to hit the Dreamcast. Players assume the role of Maken, a supernatural entity that can "brain-jack" the minds and bodies of other characters to utilize their particular strengths and knowledge. Not a bad skill, especially given the evil and gruesome baddies that Maken must overcome. Using a unique lock-on system that targets an opponent's weakest area, Maken takes advantage of a variety of hand-held weapons. As the story unfolds through 20 massive levels, your specific actions will decide your gaming route (as well as which ending you'll uncover).</plot>

One day, while reminiscing on the events from the past, you stumble upon a pair of abandoned marionettes, Marine and Maria. You take Marine under your care while your classmate Alessa takes the other one. While Alessa dont think of marionettes as anything more than a bunch of circuits pieced together, you experience tells you thats not true and you decide to prove her wrong by once again raising your marionette to a near-human form.[CR]This visual novel comes with a typical interface for such adventure games, and also includes unlockable CG album, but aside from regular story dialogues your main focus in the game would be to construct and upgrade your marionette to act as close as humanly possible. You can teach her communication or you can focus on construction of her physique and functional processing. While you can change her appearance with different outfit or skin and hair color, that will not change her personality or the ability to reason or understand or act differently. For that you will need to acquire and install better CPU, mother board, cooler, generator and other such parts.</plot>

Gameplay is similar to Fighting Force 2, as you lead Max through expansive levels pummeling your foes with bare fists. The game also features voice-overs by the cast of the television show, adding dramatic flair to the proceedings.</plot>

    <plot>You wake up at the strange loud sound coming from the bathroom. You get up from the bed and go to check what it was. Duh, it was Sandia and her strange animal companion wreaking havoc. Quick flashback to a couple of days ago, as you were waiting for your father at the airport to return from a negotiation mission from a country devastated by the civil war, to your surprise, he brought someone with him. That someone was Sandia, a princess of the country he just returned from, in danger for her life. It just so happens she'll be staying with your from now on, indefinitely as it seems.[CR]You are Kouki Akiba, a high-school student with a regular boring school life with nothing to cause your sudden elevation in blood pressure. But that's about to change when princess Sandia who recently started living with you enters the same school you are attending. But where there are problems, there are obstacles to overcome, which may over short period of time lead to something more than just friendship between Kouki and Sandia.[CR]The game itself is similar to the majority of visual novels in terms of basic gameplay, but differs in the artwork style which sets it apart from most of them. Bonus features include unlockable BGM player and CG gallery for each of the heroines.</plot>

    <plot>Monaco Grand Prix: Racing Simulation 2, also known as just Monaco Grand Prix, is a Formula one racing game for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and Dreamcast. It was released in 1999. The game is based on the Formula One World Championship, but does not have the licence to use drivers names, official cars, etc. (the licence was held by Video System at the time, who made F-1 World Grand Prix and F-1 World Grand Prix II). The game does however have a licence to use Formula One's official sponsors; Schweppes and Castrol among others,[citation needed] helping add to the authenticity of the game.[CR]The sequel to F1 Racing Simulation recreates the 1998 season, featuring 17 authentic tracks, 11 teams and cars with their 22 drivers. The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided. Telemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which the player starts with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor for the players to create their own tracks.</plot>

    <plot>Mr. Driller's world has been covered with mysterious blocks. Armed with only a mighty drill, you'll have to dig your way down to safety before his air supply runs out![CR]Mr. Driller is a real-time puzzle game that relies solely on quick-thinking and a bit of planning. The gameplay is a combination of Tetris and Boulder Dash: You have to drill down through multi-colored blocks to reach the bottom while avoiding the consequences of reckless drilling; blocks left without a foundation will drop down after a while, potentially crushing Mr. Driller. As the hero's air supply is depleted with time, the player must regularly grab oxygen pick-ups. Some of the blocks are "X-Blocks", which take a few tries to drill through and take away a large chunk of the player's air if destroyed. If four or more X-Blocks come in contact with each other, they vanish and leave behind a small blue creature "Chisokojin", which grants 765 points when picked up.[CR]There are two scenarios in the game, the "2500ft" and "5000ft challenge" (called "500m" and "1000m" in the Japanese version), which are five and ten levels long respectively.</plot>

However, an unknown enemy has transformed the Enchanted Castle into a haunted house, in turn starting a chain reaction of evil all around Pac-Land and the four Wonders. It is up to Ms. Pac-Man to enter the 3D designed worlds of the four Wonders and put the evil to rest for good.</plot>

    <plot>Rather than 5 on 5 action like professional play, this game features 3 on 3 play. Using players from the NBA, each player chooses a guard, forward, and center from the team's NBA roster for the first half and can make substitutions for the second half.[CR]NBA Hoopz is an arcade-style game and not meant to be realistic: players can jump twenty or thirty feet in the air, dunk the ball from 20 feet (6.1 m) away, and do otherwise physically impossible things. Fouls are only called on flagrant pushes, foul shots are rare (and only after a number of fouls are accumulated), and there is no out of bounds. In addition, after a player makes three consecutive shots he becomes "on fire" which allows him to make almost any shot as well as goaltend without penalty.</plot>

    <plot>Rather than 5 on 5 action like professional play, this game features 3 on 3 play. Using players from the NBA, each player chooses a guard, forward, and center from the team's NBA roster for the first half and can make substitutions for the second half.[CR]NBA Hoopz is an arcade-style game and not meant to be realistic: players can jump twenty or thirty feet in the air, dunk the ball from 20 feet (6.1 m) away, and do otherwise physically impossible things. Fouls are only called on flagrant pushes, foul shots are rare (and only after a number of fouls are accumulated), and there is no out of bounds. In addition, after a player makes three consecutive shots he becomes "on fire" which allows him to make almost any shot as well as goaltend without penalty.</plot>

Rather than typical 5 on 5 action, this game features 2 on 2 play with the ability to pick two players from any NBA team's starting line-up for the first half and can choose again for the second.[CR]The game introduces personal fouls for each shove on another player; after a certain number of fouls the opposing team gets a free throw. The game retains the series standard "on fire" feature. After a player makes three consecutive shots he becomes "on fire", which allows him to easily make shots from almost anywhere, as well as goaltend without penalty and push opponents without being charged a foul.

    <plot>No refs... No rules... Just 'classic' gridiron. Late hits, pass interferences, and other penalties are encouraged (though you can't run offside). Cheerleaders in, well, cheerleading uniforms liven up the end of the first and third quarter and there's enough stats to make the mathematically inclined happy. However, the teams features are not entirely based on real life (Indy was at the top), and it is not as addictive as the old-fashioned PC games of the early 1990's, but still a good game for someone who doesn't mind not-so-classic, almost XFL style football.</plot>

    <plot>The player controls Arsia, a young girl, wandering around Napple town and levels themed around the four seasons. To restore peace, Arsia and her pet creatures will have to collect six "petals". [CR]Although the game is primarily a platform game, there are many people to talk to and a complete story accompanying the action. Exploration parts mainly develop in Napple with a third person view, while the platformer levels, the four seasons, gets a 2D side-scrolling camera. In side-scrolling levels, Arsia usually has to complete the level and fight against a boss. Several levels requires certain items or people to talk to, meaning that the player might need to revisit some levels several times to go on with the quest.[CR]The game setting is influenced by European fairy tale tradition, with classical cartoon-looking characters (somewhat reminding of Alice in Wonderland) and colored houses. For example, Pierrot the clown, talking trees, and a cow barman appear in the game.[CR]Napple Tale also offers micro-management with pets, items, and a complex process to create new creatures or items by combining several of them in various ways (similar to the store in Power Stone 2 or all games of the Atelier series). The player can also be carried out collecting all cards and be sure that he or she has seen everything in the game.</plot>

    <plot>Golden Logres is another pinball simulator by LittleWing. A sequel to both Tristan and Crystal Caliburn, the game features three tables based on the Arthurian legends: Camelot, Land's End and Fisher King. After completing all the missions on one table, the game moves to the next one. A practice mode is available to test the last two tables and prepare to the full game.[CR]In Camelot, the first table, the objective is to complete all quests, each assigned to a different knight of the round table. The screen shows two medieval banners with the table sitting at the middle. The banners list the active quests, the score, the number of balls left and the status of the game. To start one of the adventures, the player must shoot ramps, sink the ball in holes or drop targets a number of times and then hit the Taliessin holder near the Merlin ramp. Taliessin was a court jester, musician and poet, and he assigns the quests to the knights. When an event occurs, like the end of a quest, a small window appears over the table with a picture and text explaining the situation. After all the quests are complete, the game moves to the next table after hitting the drop targets for the sloth, envy and lust sins, and sinking the ball in the quest hole.[CR]In the second table called Land's End, Lancelot, Tristan and Gawain, the three knights considered the bravest of them all, must prove their courage by undertaking the most dangerous quests. A multiball starts after completing each adventure. Tristan has to kill the dragon, by shooting its ramp and turning on all the lights that spell its name, then sink the ball in the medicine and "myst" hole. Lancelot must lift the curse that fell upon Dolorous Gard, his castle, by shooting the castle ramp and turning on "CASTLE", and receive a gift from the Lady of the Lake after dropping the ball in the magic shield hole. Gawain has to defeat the Green Knight by hitting the "ERRANTRY" ramp to turn on the letter lights, and collect a proof of bravery from Lady Bercilak by getting the ball inside the sash hole. When all the quests are complete, the game switches back to Camelot automatically.[CR]In the final Fisher King table, the ultimate goal is to collect the holy grail from the castle. The three guardians of the grail (Perceval, Bors, and Galahad) must acquire the holy relic and bring it back to Camelot. They receive the aid of other three fellow knights: Balin, Gareth and Palomides. Balin must get the Longinus spear that pierced Jesus on the cross, by turning on its name hitting the "LONGINUS" spot targets, and enter the castle at the top of the table. Gareth has to defeat the three evil knights, by sinking the ball in the challenge hole and dropping the red, blue and black targets, and finally send the ball to the castle to start a multiball. Palomides must kill Arthur's sin, that became a monster after his death, by shooting the beast lane turning on the "BEAST" lights, and sinking the ball in the castle. The grail knights retrieve the sacred cup by hitting the holy targets and the Perceval hole, both activated after colliding with bumpers named after each knight, turning on the "HOLY GRAIL" letters at the center. A multiball starts after entering the castle and receiving the grail. After all modes are finished, the game returns to Camelot.</plot>

    <plot>July is a mystery adventure game that follows the story of two young men, Makoto Tanimura (19-year old) and Joshua (29-year old) who set on a quest to uncover the mystery behind a bombing that took place several years ago. The story of the two play separately in their own chapters and can be progressed in any order, one chapter at the time. While their stories start separately, their paths cross when they uncover the truth behind the bombing and how it all ties to a secret corporation known as NAX.[CR]July is more of a visual novel where player advances through dialogues and choices, and travels to different locations, than typical adventure with clickable objects and inventory items. The map is a big part of interface and chooses many locations that player can visit as events are triggered by visiting the right place at the right time. The game uses anime style character art with pre-rendered backgrounds and occasional pre-rendered animated cut-scenes. There is no voice-acting, however, neither for player characters nor for NPCs.</plot>

    <plot>Ooga Booga is an online multiplayer game for the Dreamcast, focusing on the combat of "Kahunas" using thrown shrunken heads, riding animals, staffs, or using spells. The storyline is that Ooga Booga is a volcano goddess that creates islands, and has leaders of tribes, the Kahunas, that battle for her favor. It has a distinct Polynesian style and tone, and has many multiplayer islands and characters which can be unlocked. It was one of the last online games for the Dreamcast. There are four basic Kahunas that the player can use - Hottie (balanced), Fatty (strong), Twitchy (fast), and Hoodoo (spells). There are other unlockable Kahunas based on the main four. Some of them include Death (a floating skeleton), Abe (Former U.S. President Abraham Lincoln), Superguy (superhero), and Dwarf (a dwarf). There are multiple masks for each base Kahuna, unlocked by winning enough matches. There are many different arenas as well, varying from a pyramid to a jungle island to a small and empty desert. It received very positive reviews, including a 9.6 from IGN.</plot>

    <plot>It is the Taishou Era in Japan, and the Western world has begun to make its way through traditional Japan. Technology is evolving, and the use of steam has made for great breakthroughs in transportation in weaponry. But the world faces a deadly threat: a dark cult wishes to destroy Japan and the very world itself. To combat any possible threats, the Imperial government of Japan brings together 6 young ladies from around the world to form the Hanagumi (Flower Bridage) division of the Teikoku Kagekidan (Imperial Floral Assault Group). Clad in their proud spiritual armor, the Kobou, these young women are the frontline of defense against the demon worshippers, but they haven't a leader to guide them into battle.[CR]And, with a single letter, young Navy ensign Ichiro Ogami's life is about to take a very interesting turn as the chosen leader of the Hanagumi! Ichiro now has to gain the trust of the members of the Hanagumi if he expects to keep things under control.[CR]The gameplay of Sakura Taisen is a combination of Japanese-style adventure with dating mechanics and tactical turn-based combat. Most of the game is spent exploring the theater, which serves as a disguise for the military base. Depending on the player's decisions - where to go, which girl to look for, how to answer the questions (there is a time limit for responses) - the protagonist will develop different relationships with the girls, which will influence not only further dialogues and the ending, but also slightly affect their parameters in battles. During combat, the player navigates Ichiro and the girls over an isometric battlefield and attack the enemies physically, or charge for powerful special attacks. Each turn it is possible to perform two different actions per character; walking distance and attack range are limited and unique to each character. There is no experience points system and also no equipment in the game.</plot>

    <plot>In _Pia Carrot e Yokoso!!_ , the player controls Yusuke Kinoshita, a 18-year-old male Japanese high-school student. He intends to have a cool summer vacation, but realizes he has no money. Having no choice, he takes a job in his father's restaurant, "Pia Carrot". Thus begins an adventure much more exciting than the summer vacation he has dreamed about: he gets to know many beautiful girls in the restaurant, and has to decide which one is the love of his life...[CR]The game is a true _dating simulation_ , with the gameplay focusing on making schedules and choosing activities for the protagonist. In the beginning of each day, the player typically choose an action before it's time to go to work. These actions range from giving a call to any of the girls the hero meets during the game, going to different locations, simply resting, etc. While at work, the player should make a schedule for Yusuke, sending him to work in different places (kitchen, basement, counter, etc.). After work, it's time to choose which girl to talk to. There are also many events that prompt the player to choose an action or a conversation option.[CR]All these actions influence Yusuke's statistics, ultimately making him more (or less) attractive to the various girls he meets on his path. Depending on the way the player shapes and schedules the activities of the main character, he will follow one of the many different narratives, meet different people, and eventually - if the player is persistent enough - win the heart of the girl he loves.[CR]The computer and the PC-FX versions feature scenes with explicit nudity and sexual situations.</plot>

    <plot>Plus Plum is an action puzzle game released in Japan in 1999 and published by Takuyo. Gameplay is similar to Tetris where red, blue, yellow, green, white, or purple spheres drop from the top of the screen one at a time and must be matched with similar colors in an adjacent row. The player places the spheres and that toggle in color as they fall from red to blue, yellow to green, or white to purple. If three or more spheres of similar color are dropped adjacent to one another, the line of spheres will disappear, and any spheres above will fall to next level. All spheres touching the line that disappears will switch to their alternate colors. The twist on the typical Tetris-gameplay is that the spheres fall onto a platform that can only hold so much weight before it gradually gives way under the strain of too many spheres and gets pushed to the bottom of the screen.</plot>

The Dreamcast version includes all three heroines: Yumi Aida, Shizuka Houjouin, and Fumio Ueno. While the PSX version supports PocketStation, the Dreamcast version uses visual memory which also uses graphical representation of the character you are interacting with, and emphasizes what is currently happening on the main screen. You can meet the girls, buy them gifts, talk to them, check the progress status, and play various mini-games. The game also includes printed stickers of all three heroines with some additional artwork as well.</plot>

    <plot>pop'n music is the first title in Konami's long-running rhythm game series, and the second Bemani series after the original beatmania. Very similar to its sister game beatmania, pop'n music ditches the turntable and keyboard in favor of nine large candy-colored buttons, but otherwise plays much the same. Notes scroll toward the bottom of the screen, and the player must tap the correct buttons in time with the music to play along. Play well, and the "groove meter" increases, but play poorly and it will drop. If the groove meter is high enough at the end of the song, the player can move on to the next song.[CR]This first release includes all of the music from the original arcade release, along with several new original tracks. There is also the standard arcade mode, along with a training mode and a beginner's mode that only uses 5 or 7 of the 9 buttons.</plot>

CSK Research Institute, the developer of the Aero Dancing series, hopes to change that with Power Jet Racing 2001, a water-based racing game for the Dreamcast.[CR]You'll be able to select one of six racers, each with his or her favorite Jet Ski. Ryan, Kate, Max, Yuki, Spike, and Matt all have different attributes and qualities that define their riding styles. The game features several modes. The championship mode plays similar to the arcade-game format, where you have to finish each race with a high rank to get to the next one. The technical challenge mode tests your skills and abilities by requiring you to execute several different moves such as loops, barrel rolls, bunny hops, and submarines. Other modes include the balloon race, time attack, and two-player versus modes.</plot>

    <plot>The Sultan of Persia and his son-in-law are visiting the Sultan's brother, Assan. The friendly family meeting soon turns into a nightmare: Assan kills the young Prince's bodyguards, locks him up in a prison, and captures the Sultan. The reason is a little disagreement between the brothers regarding matrimonial arrangements: it appears that the Sultan had promised his daughter to Assan's son, Rugnor, and later broke his promise by letting her marry the Prince. In the resulting turmoil, the Sultan is killed, and the Princess is kidnapped by Rugnor, a ruthless half-tiger creature. The Prince must figure out a way to find Rugnor, defeat him, and rescue his wife.[CR]Prince of Persia 3D is just what its title implies: an action platformer with puzzle-solving elements in the style of the previous Prince of Persia games, but set in a three-dimensional environment. The Prince still has to time his jumps, avoid deadly traps, interact with the environment, and fight Rugnor's minions who will try to stop him.</plot>

    <plot>Princess Holiday is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Cliff Cloud. Much of its game play is spent reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story's narrative and dialogue. The text is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Cliff is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which take the place of the background art and character sprites.[1] Princess Holiday follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction.</plot>

    <plot>A hero saved the human race from utter annihilation by the gods. This same hero then was charged by the heavens to take care of young seed dropped from there. This seed becomes his daughter, and her guardian will be watching her progress.[CR]In _Princess Maker 2_ the player assumes the role of a father to the blessed daughter of the heavens. For the next eight years, the hero will nurture and guide her in the path of the player's own choosing.[CR]It is possible to choose the path of the zodiac-influenced daughter by scheduling her to jobs and schools, which will raise her statistics (strength, combat skills, cooking, faith, etc.) Each month allows the player to designate three different tasks for her to follow. Balancing between character development, stress level, health and financial income is the focus of this game.[CR]Mini sub-quests and various plot options revolve around the young lady adventuring in the wilderness, provided that she's strong enough to tame the wilds. The player can equip her with armor and weapons to fight off wandering random monsters in turn-based combat.[CR]The game starts with the daughter at age ten, from which point the player guides her until her adult years. Choices made during the course of the game will determine her eventual marital status, accomplishments and her relationships with other people. There are 74 unique endings in the game.</plot>

While the goal is to get close to various girls and get together with the girl you like, unless you find a way to break the time loop, after the day resets you will have to do the wooing all over again, which may be play if you decide to go for a different girl. The game is a typical visual novel game which uses static 2D anime style characters over background which is comprised in small portion of an artwork showing the location while majority is the window frame itself with dialogue window pasted over the character you are talking to.</plot>

    <plot>The story begins in 1997. It's the dead of night in the city of Los Angeles, and there has been a mass murder at a general hospital on the outskirts of downtown. The perpetrator is the director of the hospital, Richter Harris. He has shut himself up in the hospital and taken a number of patients as hostages, leaving the police helpless and unable to move in. Richter's only daughter, Laura Harris, after hearing the situation, rushes to Los Angeles from San Francisco, and drives alone to the tragic scene at the hospital ground. Upon entering the hospital Laura finds herself transported to an old mansion, while the disembodied voice of her father pleads with her to leave. Nevertheless she must press forward to save her father and herself.[CR] _D_ is a puzzle game requiring Laura to solve esoteric inventory puzzles on a very strict time limit. Each of the game's four discs must be completed in about thirty minutes each, and saving is not an option. The time is kept track of using Laura's pocket watch. The pocket watch can also be used to supply hints for puzzles, but after three uses the glass will shatter and it will stop working. The game also has multiple endings.</plot>

    <plot>Psychic Force 2012, the sequel to Psychic Force, is a one-on-one fighting game with a twist. The matches take place inside a giant floating cube. You are able to fly, using your psychic abilities, around a 3D arena with six walls. Each of the ten available characters, Might, Regina, Wendy, Emilio, Setsuna, Patty, Gudeath, Genshin, Carlo, and Gates, are controlled with three buttons: guard, weak attack and strong attack. The effect varies with the distance. Next to the regular life meter, there is also a power meter. By using special moves, the meter is drained and your moves are limited. It is possible to recharge, and the capacity of the power meter expands when you lose a lot of health.[CR]Additionally, each fighter has its own unique moves, energy attacks and a weapon, which they use, mid-flight, to pummel their opponent. There are three main game modes: training, versus and a story mode using static anime-inspired images and in-engine cut scenes to tell the story. The story centers around two groups of psychics with differing ideals about co-existence with humans. In the middle of this are several neutral psychics with ties to members in either group.</plot>

    <plot>Puyo Puyo Fever (puyopuyohuiba), renamed Puyo Pop Fever for international release, is the fifth "main" installment in the Puyo Puyo series, originally developed for Sega NAOMI arcade hardware by Sonic Team. It was the first completely original Puyo Puyo title to be produced after the original developers, Compile, filed for bankruptcy.[CR]Puyo Puyo Fever is as close as the series has come to a reboot, abandoning most of Compile's Madou Monogatari characters and settings in favour of a new, original cast engineered by Sonic Team. However saying this, the game's story still remains canon with prior games, as Arle and Carbuncle are transported to this new world after the former's magic fails.</plot>

    <plot>Puyo Puyo~n (puyopuyo~ n), often referred to as Puyo Puyo 4 is an entry in the Puyo Puyo series of games. It was first released for the Sega Dreamcast (rather than an arcade platform) in 1999. Like previous games in the series, the title of the game is a play on words - "yon", the Japanese word for four, appears if you pronounce the game's name as "Puyo Puyon" (furthermore, puyo in various Madou Monogatari games also say this). As with most games in the series, Puyo Puyo~n did not leave Japan.</plot>

    <plot>Monaco Grand Prix: Racing Simulation 2, also known as just Monaco Grand Prix, is a Formula one racing game for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and Dreamcast. It was released in 1999. The game is based on the Formula One World Championship, but does not have the licence to use drivers names, official cars, etc. (the licence was held by Video System at the time, who made F-1 World Grand Prix and F-1 World Grand Prix II). The game does however have a licence to use Formula One's official sponsors; Schweppes and Castrol among others,[citation needed] helping add to the authenticity of the game.[CR]The sequel to F1 Racing Simulation recreates the 1998 season, featuring 17 authentic tracks, 11 teams and cars with their 22 drivers. The Monaco license is used, although the teams themselves are not licensed. A total of 22 camera views are provided. Telemetry is stored and analysed in a similar way to Grand Prix 2, and physics are modeled to be realistic. There are eight different modes to race, the new ones being a career mode in which the player starts with a poor team and must drive well enough to earn competitive rides, and scenarios recreating key races for particular drivers. Returning from the first game are Time Attack, a full championship, and a 50s retro mode. There is also a track editor for the players to create their own tracks.</plot>

    <plot>Radirgy is a vertical-screen top-down bullet-hell shooter originally developed by Milestone for Naomi arcade system and later released on console systems. The game features bright, cartoony, cel-shaded graphics. At the beginning, the player is given choice among three different mecha-ships: one with a spread-gun, a weak homing laser, or a slow but powerful bubble gun. Additionally, each ship can use a sword for anything that gets too close, or specific enemies which can't be killed otherwise, a shield, which appears at the front of the ship once the player lets go of the fire button, and a smart-bomb-like field that can be extended around the player in a small circle, damaging enemies, absorbing their shots and turning them into points.</plot>

    <plot>Another shooter in the Cotton saga. Trouble brews in the homeland of Cotton's long time friend Silk, as the evil demon Suede steals the legendary Willow candy from the queen's castle. Seeing as how no one can face Suede and his forces Silk drafts Cotton in order to restore peace to her land, but she may have forgotten that Cotton is a big fan of Willow candies herself...[CR]Gameplay-wise Rainbow Cotton actually follows in the steps of Panorama Cotton as the gameplay switches from a 2D perspective to a 3rd person one. The gameplay itself however is reminiscent of games like Panzer Dragoon, in which you don't control Cotton as she flies, but instead where she aims with her magic spells. You can shoot down enemies as well as open chests, doors and other bonus locations for power-ups and spells, which advance Cotton's abilities in an rpg-lite fashion and increase your arsenal with different magical powers.[CR]Taking advantage of the technological advances, the game uses for the first time polygonal graphics and to complement the action the game features 2D animated cutscenes between levels.</plot>

    <plot>Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2 is a boxing game for the Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, and Game Boy Advance. It is also the sequel to Ready 2 Rumble Boxing.[CR]Gameplay in the game is similar to that of the previous game. The more big hits the player land consecutively, letters that spell out "RUMBLE" appear below the player's side of the screen. Letters also appear when the fighter taunts his opponent. Once the word is formed, powerful combo attacks can be activated that will almost definitely knock the opponent down. This time, however, there are three levels of "RUMBLE", which build up one after the other. If the player successfully lands a combo with his RUMBLE Meter full on the third level (where the letters start smoking), the final blow can launch the opponent clear out of the ring, giving the player an instant victory.</plot>

    <plot>The game is set two months after the events of the first Resident Evil, in the Midwestern American mountain community of Raccoon City. Nearly all of its citizens have been transformed into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus, a new type of biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. The game's two protagonists are Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie police officer on his first day in the local force, and Claire Redfield, a college student looking for her brother Chris. Having just arrived in the city, Leon and Claire make their way to the Raccoon Police Department, seeking protection from the mutated population. There, they discover that most of the policemen have been killed already, and that Chris has left town to investigate the Umbrella headquarters in Europe. With no remaining motivation to stay, the two protagonists split up to look for other survivors and flee the city. While searching for an escape route, Claire meets a little girl named Sherry, who is on the run from an unknown creature, and Leon encounters Ada Wong, who claims to be looking for her boyfriend John, an Umbrella researcher.</plot>

    <plot>The game is set two months after the events of the first Resident Evil, in the Midwestern American mountain community of Raccoon City. Nearly all of its citizens have been transformed into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus, a new type of biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. The game's two protagonists are Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie police officer on his first day in the local force, and Claire Redfield, a college student looking for her brother Chris. Having just arrived in the city, Leon and Claire make their way to the Raccoon Police Department, seeking protection from the mutated population. There, they discover that most of the policemen have been killed already, and that Chris has left town to investigate the Umbrella headquarters in Europe. With no remaining motivation to stay, the two protagonists split up to look for other survivors and flee the city. While searching for an escape route, Claire meets a little girl named Sherry, who is on the run from an unknown creature, and Leon encounters Ada Wong, who claims to be looking for her boyfriend John, an Umbrella researcher.</plot>

    <plot>Roadsters is a car racing game that features both licensed cars from manufacturers like Mitsubishi, Alfa Romeo, Lotus, etc., and unlicensed cars from imaginary manufacturers that are based and bear great resemblance to their equivalent, real car models. The game has 8 racers and 34 cars from which you can choose from and 4 modes in total:[CR] Roadster Trophy - The player starts by selecting one of the available racers and is given a sum of money that must be used to acquire a car. There are 3 divisions in which the player can compete on with the 3rd being of the easiest difficulty and requiring less money to participate; the 1st being the most difficult one and needing a higher amount of money in order to participate. More money can be earned by winning the races and that in turn allows to buy new cars or upgrade the ones that are already in possession.[CR] Multi-Player - Multi-player mode supports up to 2 human players that can compete in any of the available circuits with 4 more CPU controlled racers. The mode allows for either vertical or horizontal split screen.[CR] Quick Race - In Quick Race the player can select the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions, and race against 7 more CPU controlled players.[CR] Time Trial - Like Quick Race mode, the player can also select here the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions but without the competition of the other modes, the player races against time for as many laps as the player wants.</plot>

    <plot>Roadsters is a car racing game that features both licensed cars from manufacturers like Mitsubishi, Alfa Romeo, Lotus, etc., and unlicensed cars from imaginary manufacturers that are based and bear great resemblance to their equivalent, real car models. The game has 8 racers and 34 cars from which you can choose from and 4 modes in total:[CR] Roadster Trophy - The player starts by selecting one of the available racers and is given a sum of money that must be used to acquire a car. There are 3 divisions in which the player can compete on with the 3rd being of the easiest difficulty and requiring less money to participate; the 1st being the most difficult one and needing a higher amount of money in order to participate. More money can be earned by winning the races and that in turn allows to buy new cars or upgrade the ones that are already in possession.[CR] Multi-Player - Multi-player mode supports up to 2 human players that can compete in any of the available circuits with 4 more CPU controlled racers. The mode allows for either vertical or horizontal split screen.[CR] Quick Race - In Quick Race the player can select the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions, and race against 7 more CPU controlled players.[CR] Time Trial - Like Quick Race mode, the player can also select here the racer, car, circuit and weather conditions but without the competition of the other modes, the player races against time for as many laps as the player wants.</plot>

    <plot>Chain-smoking Neji Taihei is an average Japanese guy, lives by himself in his apartment, and is kind of a loser. Naturally, just letting the guy continue being a loser isn't particularly interesting, so a spirit that happens to also live in his apartment starts to toy with his daily life.[CR]You can affect Neji in two different ways. If he's not around, you can interact with things in his apartment like moving his table, or locking his door. If he is around, you can throw little ping-pong balls at objects to focus his attention on them. If you throw too many too fast, though, he'll get depressed and ignore you.[CR]The game follows a calendar with different missions to do on different days. Each mission in the game starts with a short video showing what you need to get Neji to do, which can be something simple like making him use his computer or drink a glass of water, or something more complicated like getting him to order something from a TV ad. Depending on your success in each mission, the outcome will change, and you will determine if Neji remains a loser for the rest of his life.</plot>

    <plot>Roommate Novel: Yuka Sato (rumumeitonoberu ~ Zuo Teng You Xiang ~ ) is a standalone visual novel not related to previously released Roommate games which focused on Inoue Ryoko heroine, developed by the same company. Unlike in previous games, this game emphasizes word "novel" in its title by having the game play resemble that of a visual novel without built-in clock and time progress as in previous titles. Heroine in this story is Yuka Satou (Zuo Teng You Xiang ) which one day suddenly appears on your doorstep. You returned to your hometown from Tokyo for the summer, and you end up sharing a place with Yuka during the holidays. The text screen with player choices appears over the entire image instead of a dialogue window, and choices made by the player will lead to one of multiple endings.</plot>

    <plot>It is the Taishou Era in Japan, and the Western world has begun to make its way through traditional Japan. Technology is evolving, and the use of steam has made for great breakthroughs in transportation in weaponry. But the world faces a deadly threat: a dark cult wishes to destroy Japan and the very world itself. To combat any possible threats, the Imperial government of Japan brings together 6 young ladies from around the world to form the Hanagumi (Flower Bridage) division of the Teikoku Kagekidan (Imperial Floral Assault Group). Clad in their proud spiritual armor, the Kobou, these young women are the frontline of defense against the demon worshippers, but they haven't a leader to guide them into battle.[CR]And, with a single letter, young Navy ensign Ichiro Ogami's life is about to take a very interesting turn as the chosen leader of the Hanagumi! Ichiro now has to gain the trust of the members of the Hanagumi if he expects to keep things under control.[CR]The gameplay of Sakura Taisen is a combination of Japanese-style adventure with dating mechanics and tactical turn-based combat. Most of the game is spent exploring the theater, which serves as a disguise for the military base. Depending on the player's decisions - where to go, which girl to look for, how to answer the questions (there is a time limit for responses) - the protagonist will develop different relationships with the girls, which will influence not only further dialogues and the ending, but also slightly affect their parameters in battles. During combat, the player navigates Ichiro and the girls over an isometric battlefield and attack the enemies physically, or charge for powerful special attacks. Each turn it is possible to perform two different actions per character; walking distance and attack range are limited and unique to each character. There is no experience points system and also no equipment in the game.</plot>

    <plot>It is the Taishou Era in Japan, and the Western world has begun to make its way through traditional Japan. Technology is evolving, and the use of steam has made for great breakthroughs in transportation in weaponry. But the world faces a deadly threat: a dark cult wishes to destroy Japan and the very world itself. To combat any possible threats, the Imperial government of Japan brings together 6 young ladies from around the world to form the Hanagumi (Flower Bridage) division of the Teikoku Kagekidan (Imperial Floral Assault Group). Clad in their proud spiritual armor, the Kobou, these young women are the frontline of defense against the demon worshippers, but they haven't a leader to guide them into battle.[CR]And, with a single letter, young Navy ensign Ichiro Ogami's life is about to take a very interesting turn as the chosen leader of the Hanagumi! Ichiro now has to gain the trust of the members of the Hanagumi if he expects to keep things under control.[CR]The gameplay of Sakura Taisen is a combination of Japanese-style adventure with dating mechanics and tactical turn-based combat. Most of the game is spent exploring the theater, which serves as a disguise for the military base. Depending on the player's decisions - where to go, which girl to look for, how to answer the questions (there is a time limit for responses) - the protagonist will develop different relationships with the girls, which will influence not only further dialogues and the ending, but also slightly affect their parameters in battles. During combat, the player navigates Ichiro and the girls over an isometric battlefield and attack the enemies physically, or charge for powerful special attacks. Each turn it is possible to perform two different actions per character; walking distance and attack range are limited and unique to each character. There is no experience points system and also no equipment in the game.</plot>

    <plot>In the third installment of the Sakura Taisen series, Ichiro Ogami goes to Paris, to command the pretty girls of Paris Kagekidan (Flower Assault Squad), led by the lovely Erica. Just as in Japan, this special unit has a complex base which is disguised as a theater, since the girls of Paris Kagekidan can can act on stage as well as pilot huge steam-powered mechs. An unknown evil is threatening the city, so it's time for Ichiro to take command and save Paris from the demonic threat.[CR]Sakura Taisen 3 retains the basic gameplay style of the series, being a hybrid of dating-oriented role-playing (with timed responses during conversations with the girls, and the possibility to conquer the heart of one of them), and strategic turn-based battles. The game features fully 3D graphics for the battles and the map of Paris (although the locations in adventure mode are still 2D still images). The interface for the battles has been modified: you can move your mechs physically on the battle field instead of pointing and clicking, and an action points-based system replaces the "two different commands per turn" style of the first two games.</plot>

    <plot>SIn the fourth installment of the Sakura Taisen series, Ichiro Ogami returns to Japan after having defeated the evil that threatened Paris. Something is once again wrong in the Imperial Capital, as two street cars go berserk without any reason, saved only by the mech-commanding girls of the Hanagumi Brigade. The girls from Paris Kagekidan return to join forces with the original cast, to help Ichiro defeat evil one more time.[CR]Sakura Taisen 4 utilizes the same gameplay mechanics as its predecessor, including a virtually identical combat scheme. As always, you have to choose and time your responses well to attract the attention of one of the lovely girls you command. Unlike the three previous games, this game is not divided into chapters.</plot>

    <plot>Samba De Amigo is a highly unique game: a maracas simulation. Game play is based around a special maracas controller that you use to interact with the music. The controller senses which region in space out of a possible 6 that the maracas are in. It also senses when the player shakes the maracas. As the music plays, the player must shake the maracas in the appropriate region with proper timing to progress. A standard controller can also be used if you do not have the maracas controller, which is sold separately.[CR]The music in the game comes from a wide variety of sources. Some of the songs are traditional samba music, while others are recognizable pop tunes, like "Macarena" and "Tequila.</plot>

    <plot>_Romance of the Three Kingdoms V_ is the fifth game in the popular turn-based strategy game series, based on the classic medieval Chinese novel "San Guo" ("Three Kingdoms"). The novel, written by Luo Guanzhong, is perhaps the most popular classic book in China and all countries influenced by the Chinese culture (such as Japan). Its events occur in the third century AD, during the Later Han Dynasty. Several army leaders (the most important ones being Liu Bei, Cao Cao, Sun Jian) are trying to unite China under their rule, and each one strives to defeat his opponents.[CR] _Romance of the Three Kingdoms V_ offers many innovations. You won't only participate at wars, but also manage your country, and learn resource management of people and goods. A new "Reputation" parameter directly affects the people's opinion of you as the leader. Multiplayer allows participation of up to eight players (playing the eight main characters).[CR]The game was never translated into English. It was released in Japan for the PC (both DOS and Windows), and for PlayStation. A Chinese translation of the game (DOS version) is available.</plot>

    <plot>Sega Marine Fishing is a fishing video game in which the player attempts to catch various marine sport fish. The gameplay's emphasis was on enticing fish to bite onto the lure and then successfully fighting the fish and reeling it to the boat.[CR]As the player catches fish, they earn item cards. Items earned with these cards include fish and artifacts for an aquarium, fishing equipment, additional boats, and various goofy accessories such as different colored shorts. The game also featured two modes of online play: tournament fishing and "fish mail". In tournament fishing, players competed to catch the biggest fish within a species. Fish mail consisted of writing short messages. Players could receive random messages by catching fish.[CR]Sega Marine Fishing can be played using the Dreamcast fishing rod controller.

    <plot>Sega Tetris is an officially licensed Tetris game originally made for arcades that can be played in both single player and multi player modes. The game uses polygonal graphics with animated backgrounds. As progress through the game is made these change and take the player to numerous different settings. [CR]When playing alone the game is very much true to the original Tetris but with some differences. The game is played with a joystick for moving the blocks around as they fall and two buttons to rotate them left and right. As the game's level is raised the speed of the falling block will also increase and since it's an arcade game it will reach a high pace relatively early. One addition to the game is a slot machine and the symbol it stops on depends on the number of lines cleared. By matching all the three wheels the player will get a large bonus. [CR]The two player versus mode adds special attacks to the gameplay and these are activated by clearing lines. Clearing two lines will lead to a joint attack where two stuck together blocks will fall while clearing three lines will lead to a long block falling. By creating a tetris (clearing four lines) stacked lines will rise from the bottom of the playfield. Some attacks come from clearing multiple lines that are apart from each other. This includes a missile attack that destroys block and a K.O. attack that knocks out the opponent preventing him from controlling the blocks for a short while. There is also a four player mode where two cabinets are connected. On the Dreamcast version the multiplayer mode can be played online.</plot>

    <plot>This game is an upgrade to Sega Worldwide Soccer 2000, with an improved graphical engine and the possibility to let you play the Euro 2000 celebrated in Holland and Belgium. Other available game modes are the World Cup (where you could compete as any of the 64 best teams in the world), National leagues (Italian, Spanish, English, German, Japanese, etc), International leagues and friendly match. Regarding player licenses, this game takes the same position as World League Soccer 98; that is, player names will resemble those of their real life counterparts, but will not be exactly the same (although curiously, game commentators will pronounce them correctly).</plot>

    <plot>Sentimental Graffiti 2 happens some time after the first game, and instead of high-school setting it fast forwards to college setting. However, the protagonist in this game is 2nd year university student, Kouhei Shiina, whereas the original protagonist from the first game had died in an accident and while he is not present in this game, all the heroines he met in the original game are back in this sequel, ready for the new protagonist to meet them for the very first time and start a relationship. Kouhei is a member of a photography club and is looking for someone who will model for his photo exhibition for the upcoming college festival. That's where twelve heroines come in.[CR]The game is played in both 1st-person and 3rd-person isometric perspective. While 1st-person perspective is used in communication with other characters and looking at places up close, the isometric view is used while traversing the city which features many locations which can be accessed. Both city and locations are affected by the time of day and will feature different graphics during morning, twilight or night, as well as affecting stores and other locations which may be open or closed at the decided time. The map features 29 locations in total, some of which can be further explored from the inside. Your actions cost time and clock progresses whenever you do something or go someplace. By the end of the day, you return to your dorm and continue the exploration the next day.</plot>

    <plot>Seventh Cross: Evolution, known in Japan as simply Seventh Cross, is a video game for the Sega Dreamcast video game console. It was released in Japan on December 23, 1998. A sequel titled Ninth Will was announced shortly after the game's North American release, but it was apparently cancelled.[CR]The theme of Seventh Cross is evolution. The player begins with a protist, and through eating and consuming, progresses through two other stages until it becomes an animal. The game begins in a lagoon, where the player's organism must avoid predators while nourishing itself. If the creature dies, it is returned to its lowest form unless it has successfully evolved into its 'origin' stage, in which case the creature regresses to that instead. After death, any parts gained by evolution are kept, but any gathered food is lost.[CR]Seventh Cross contains six stages, each with a boss. The stages take place in different biomes, ranging from the pond to a barren future.</plot>

In Shadow Man your mission is to prevent five serial killers from bringing the total Armageddon. In the world of the living, you're mortal and have conventional weapons. When you die, you are transported to the world of the dead and you become Shadow Man once again. Which means you're not really mortal. In the world of the dead you can't use normal weapons, your gun shoots ghosts which kill the zombies and the other ugly creatures which live there. You also have different voodoo powers and weapons. And you're carrying a large inventory around.</plot>

    <plot>The story revolves around Shunhei Yahagi (Shi Qiu Jun Ping ), a 19-year old high-school graduate who failed to enter the college of his choosing. Due to the circumstance, he takes on the role of an assistant teacher in a summer course school managed by Natsumi Yahagi (Shi Qiu natsumi), his older sister. There he helps younger students, who just happen to be all girls, learn for their exams. While taking the position of an assistant teacher, his relationship with the student, as well as other girls he meets start to evolve.[CR]This romance oriented visual novel adventure game comes with all the expected gameplay elements that are usually found in the genre such as hiding on-screen text in order to see clear background picture or branching story based on player's actions and dialogue choices. The background locations use the processed actual photos, while the characters use typical anime art. Background image is obscured by a frame pattern which makes the location art displayed in widescreen. During the gameplay, the current location, time of day, and the title of a background track currently playing are displayed.</plot>

    <plot>The story opens with a young Silvite woman named Fina sailing through the night skies in her tiny Silver airship. Not far behind her, Valuan Admiral Alfonso is in hot pursuit under orders from Lord Galcian to capture her. Alfonso opens fire on and disables Fina's ship long enough to capture her before it plummets into Deep Sky, but just as she is being brought onboard his warship, a Blue Rogue vessel arrives with the intent of robbing the Valuan vessel. Vyse and Aika of the Blue Rogues jump from the Albatross onto Alfonso's flagship and fight their way to the rear cargo hold, prompting Alfonso to flee on a lifeboat while leaving Fina behind along with the war beast Antonio, who is quickly defeated by the Rogues. Vyse and Aika bring Fina back to their clan's ship, which Vyse pilots back to their secret hideout, Pirate Island (disguised as a small village).</plot>

    <plot>Soldier of Fortune is a first person shooter game originally released for the Sega Dreamcast.[CR]A terrorist organization has stolen nuclear weapons from a facility in Russia, intending to sell them to various third-world nations, initiating a global conflict. The player takes the role of John Mullins, a US mercenary working for an organization known as "The Shop". The goal is simple: hunt the villains across the globe, thwart their evil plans, and save the world![CR]Like most 3D shooters, Soldier of Fortune consists mainly of exploring the environments and killing the enemies that try to impede the player's progress. It is one of the first shooters to isolate over 20 different body regions and show/inflict damage to those regions. For example, if the player character shoots an enemy in the foot, the enemy will limp. The game was also notable for including realistic gore animations resulting from the injuries sustained by the enemies.</plot>

    <plot>Centuries ago, the planet was bestowed the seven Chaos Emeralds. These emeralds were a source of unlimited power, and consequently it did not take long before wars broke out over who would control the Chaos Emeralds. There was also a Master Emerald, which was the controller of the Chaos Emeralds and could either negate or amplify the Chaos Emerald's power. One of the chao living near the shrine of the Emeralds accidentally made contact with the holy water in the shrine and mutated to become a peaceful creature that could use the power of water called Chaos and became the guardian of the rest of the chaos there. Later on, a tribe of echidnas, led by Pachamac, angered Chaos by attempting to steal the Chaos Emeralds, ruining the sanctuary it was protecting and attempted a mass massacre on the chao living there. They were all but completely destroyed within a single night and Chaos, in his fury, used the negative power of the Chaos Emeralds to transform into Perfect Chaos and slaughtered all the echidnas. Pachamac's daughter, Tikal, had pleaded with Pachamac but he refused to listen to her. Tikal then prayed to the Master Emerald after Perfect Chaos had left to destroy the entire world to seal herself with Chaos inside the Master Emerald.</plot>

    <plot>Centuries ago, the planet was bestowed the seven Chaos Emeralds. These emeralds were a source of unlimited power, and consequently it did not take long before wars broke out over who would control the Chaos Emeralds. There was also a Master Emerald, which was the controller of the Chaos Emeralds and could either negate or amplify the Chaos Emerald's power. One of the chao living near the shrine of the Emeralds accidentally made contact with the holy water in the shrine and mutated to become a peaceful creature that could use the power of water called Chaos and became the guardian of the rest of the chaos there. Later on, a tribe of echidnas, led by Pachamac, angered Chaos by attempting to steal the Chaos Emeralds, ruining the sanctuary it was protecting and attempted a mass massacre on the chao living there. They were all but completely destroyed within a single night and Chaos, in his fury, used the negative power of the Chaos Emeralds to transform into Perfect Chaos and slaughtered all the echidnas. Pachamac's daughter, Tikal, had pleaded with Pachamac but he refused to listen to her. Tikal then prayed to the Master Emerald after Perfect Chaos had left to destroy the entire world to seal herself with Chaos inside the Master Emerald.</plot>

    <year>1999</year>
    <plot>Sonic Adventure International is a Japanese exclusive re-release of the original Sonic Adventure. This re-release was due to Sonic Adventure being rushed to the market in Japan and having several bugs and unimplemented features. The US release had more development time thus the game was closer to what its developers had intended for it to be. Sonic Adventure International is the same as that version, but with added features.[CR]Notably, complete English and Japanese language voice tracks are included, as well as subtitles in English, German, French, and Spanish. There is also a more solid framerate, tweaked cameras, additional voice clips and a number of new download contests (some country-specific). Some graphics were tweaked or changed completely such as the removal of the neon cowgirl billboard from Casinopolis. The World Ranking mode allows people from multiple regions to upload best times to an international scoreboard for prizes.[CR]A demo of this version was made available for rent for a limited time in 1999 called Sonic Adventure: Limited Edition.</plot>

    <plot>It's the 25th century. Several lunar cycles have passed since Ulala saved human kind and repelled the Morolian invasion against Earth through dance.

The same goes for publishers: initially the games were published by Ripcord Games, and later by Take-Two Interactive. Other developers and publishers have since been brought in for spin-off titles and sequels[1][CR]The Spec Ops franchise was intended to introduce a realistic first/third-person shooter experience and immerse the player in a two-man team gameplay. The first two games were well received; and the PlayStation and Dreamcast sequels, developed by Runecraft, received lower review scores.[2] The latest game in the series, Spec Ops: The Line, was highly acclaimed for its narrative, based on the novel Heart of Darkness.</plot>

    <plot>Speed Devils is a series of video games developed by Ubisoft's Montreal studio for Microsoft Windows in 1998 and Dreamcast in 1999. Both Speed Busters: American Highways (also known as just Speed Busters) and Speed Devils are racing games in which the courses feature hazards such as dinosaurs rolling boulders, and UFOs in exotic locales including Louisiana, Louisiana Tornado, New York City, New York City Winter, Mexico, Nevada, Aspen Summer, Aspen Winter, Canada (Supposedly northern Quebec), Canada Light Winter, Canada Heavy Winter, Montreal Industrial, Hollywood, and Hollywood Disaster. The console version's career mode allowed a player to rise a racer through the ranks of a fictional racing league. Colorful rivals would challenge you to accomplish certain feats during races, making accompanying bets using prize money from competition. Money earned from gambling and performance is used to buy cars, upgrade them, and maintain them. There are 4 classes in the game.Each class had 4 people. Starting in Class D, they are Jack, Ms. Penny Parker, Alfanso, and Luigi. Class C has Vanessa, Blue Bullet, James, and Tex. Class B has Billy-Sue Bayou, Cora and Antonio Martinez, and Jake. The top class, Class A, has Cory, Pat, Yu and Driver X. Then you must beat Driver X, the boss of the game. The game also supports five players on one Dreamcast console.</plot>

    <plot>At last! The first Star Wars game for the 128-bit Dreamcast lets you participate in the famous podrace sequence (which was the critical highlight of the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I, The Phantom Menace). These lightning-quick vehicles are capable of reaching simulated speeds of up to 600 miles per hour, while skimming a mere 4 feet above the ground. You can race alone or against a friend in split-screen mode, on over more than 21 courses among eight worlds. Take the controls as Jedi-to-be Anakin Skywalker, or any one of over 20 podracers, and feel the full-force blast--while avoiding hazards such as methane lakes, meteor showers, and the unfriendly Tusken Raiders.</plot>

Some of the newest fighters on the block include a former Final Fight character (Cody, who has been in jail since the last Final Fight game, or so his clothing suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika.[CR]The major difference between this Alpha and the last two are the new play modes World Tour, Arcade, VS, Training and Entry.</plot>

    <plot>In Stunt GP, you control one of 16 different remote-controlled cars. The cars are divided in three categories: Wild-Wheels, Speed Demons and Aeroblaster, each with it's unique driving feel. The cars can be tuned up with many different tuning parts, like better batteries, tires, suspension etc. - a total of 1000 different combinations.[CR]You race on 24 original, colorful tracks with tons of bridges, ramps and loopings. You can perform absolutely breathtaking stunts on these tracks, but you need to be careful about the battery - if the car runs out of power, the race is probably over very soon. In each track you can recharge your car's battery by driving through a tunnel above the start/finish line.[CR]Of course, it's possible to play multiplayer. No network support is included, so multiplayer gaming stages on one PC in split screen mode.</plot>

    <plot>Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo, known as Super Puzzle Fighter II X (supapazuruhuaitaIIX) in Japan, is a puzzle game similar to the likes of Tetris or Puyo Puyo, developed and published by Capcom. It was brought to the Sega Saturn in 1996.[CR]Despite its name there was never a "Super Puzzle Fighter 1" - it is merely just a play on Capcom's earlier game, Super Street Fighter II Turbo. This being said, the game is actually influenced by Street Fighter Alpha and the Darkstalkers franchise, with most Street Fighter II characters missing. Though characters from both series appear in the game they are not controllable by the player, acting solely as avatars.[CR]Similar to other "falling piece" puzzle games, the aim of Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo is to eliminate your opponent by filling their playfield with blocks (or gems, in this case). In order to achieve this, you must eliminate coloured gems on your side of the play area and produce combos when doing so.[CR]As well as a Saturn port, the game was brought to the Sega Dreamcast in 2001 for Capcom's Matching Service. This version was not released outside of Japan.</plot>

    <plot>Super Runabout: San Francisco Edition is the third game in the Runabout series. The player can drive around San Francisco, crashing into objects. There are two scenarios: Scenario A places the player in control of San Francisco Motors, a kind of "messenger/delivery/bomb disposal service" rolled up in one, while Scenario B has the player controlling laid-back San Francisco police officers. The two scenarios have different missions, whether it's stopping a runaway cable car, or collecting bombs for disposal.</plot>

    <plot>Speed Devils- Online Racing is an updated version of Speed Devils that reuses the tracks and cars from the original game, adds new ones, and puts them into completely new modes with a focus on online multiplayer. The game includes online and offline options. Offline functions as a practice mode for online, and has only two modes- Arcade (for a standard race against AI-controlled opponents) and Ghost (for a one-on-one against oneself). At the start, car selection is limited and further cars can only be unlocked by playing online. The meat of the game is in Online mode. After customizing their online persona, players start with $10.000, enough to buy a car of the lowest class. Money must be earned by racing, enabling players to buy new cars and tune them with new parts. There are three kinds of races- Standard, Trial and Vendetta Standard races allow various ways of earning money, of which winning is only one- breaking speed limits at certain points and setting race records (highest speed, fastest lap time, leading the longest) also increase cash flow. Trial races involve wagering- a minimum amount is set by the race creator that all participants must pay to take part. The creator also sets between one and four challenges from a pool of 22 possible options. These include similar records as in the Standard races, but also challenges to always (or never) break the speed limit, bust the limit (but never twice on the same radar), get best times on specific laps, always improve times from lap to lap or not take any damage. The wagered money is distributed at the end of the race between all participants that completed their challenges, taking into account the difficulty of the challenge and the final positions of the racers. Vendetta races are always one-on-one, with the winner taking the loser's car. The game includes all the tracks from the first game (7 unique tracks in 12 configurations), adds a Heavy Winter configuration to the Canada track and adds one new track (Montreal) with three configurations, for a total of 16 different tracks, all of which can be raced in reverse or mirrored, and with weather and time of day selectable. The number of cars has been doubled from the original, adding an additional eleven.</plot>

As in most aquatic racers, success here depends on your ability to smoothly handle unpredictable waves and aggressive competition at the same time.[CR]There are several game modes to choose from. First up is the Championship. In this mode, you compete in a series of circuit races and accumulate points based on your finishing position. The racer with the most points at the end of the season wins. The other modes include a trick competition, a hazard and obstacle course, and a head-to-head 2-player mode.</plot>

Up to four players (human or computer-controlled) can participate in arcade and head-to-head modes. Each player can train or control a team of 12 virtual athletes for whichever nationality he or she chooses. Arcade mode allows you to jump right into any one of the 12 events and test the waters without training your athletes. Two types of play are available: classic and repeat. In classic style, you play all 12 events only once while earning points based on performance in each. Repeat play offers basically the same format with the main difference being the chance to gain higher scores by replaying the events. Olympic mode lets you train a team of 12 athletes, build strength and morale, sharpen skills and prepare for qualification at Olympic trials. This mode offers a 4-stage approach to reaching the goal of Olympic competition: training, invitation, championship, and then the Games themselves. Gymnastics and field and track are just a couple of the activities practiced in this mode.</plot>

    <plot>Sydney 2000 offers four modes of play including arcade, Olympic, head-to-head and coaching. Up to four players (human or computer-controlled) can participate in arcade and head-to-head modes. Each player can train or control a team of 12 virtual athletes for whichever nationality he or she chooses. Arcade mode allows you to jump right into any one of the 12 events and test the waters without training your athletes. Two types of play are available: classic and repeat. In classic style, you play all 12 events only once while earning points based on performance in each. Repeat play offers basically the same format with the main difference being the chance to gain higher scores by replaying the events. Olympic mode lets you train a team of 12 athletes, build strength and morale, sharpen skills and prepare for qualification at Olympic trials. This mode offers a 4-stage approach to reaching the goal of Olympic competition: training, invitation, championship, and then the Games themselves. Gymnastics and field and track are just a couple of the activities practiced in this mode.</plot>

    <plot>Taxi 2 is a driving game, based on Luc Besson's movie. Both movie and video game share the same title.[CR]Taxi 2 features two game modes. The "story mode" follows the scenes from the movie and allows you to select from five missions. When a mission is completed, you can save your progress, but also play it in the "arcade mode". In this mode, you will face the same competitor, Jean-Louis Schlesser ! The objective is no longer specific to each mission, but is to win the race, after several laps. In this mode, you will not have to care about the temperature gauge, since it is removed from arcade mode.</plot>

Upon beating the first series of races, the player will be able to move on to the other car types. Finally, Le Mans offers the Le Mans 24 hr mode.

    <plot>Tetris 4D (tetorisu huodei) is a Sega Dreamcast game developed and published by Bullet Proof Software. It is an entry in the Tetris series, and was released only in Japan.[CR]Being an early Dreamcast game, Tetris 4D does not deviate much from its predecessors. There is a classic mode (which acts as a normal game of Tetris) and a "battle" mode (which allows up to four players to compete against each other). The game has an industrial/urban theme, unlike most other entries in the series which usually have a classical architecture or Russian theme.[CR]There are no AI players in the game and no VMU support for high-score saving. Both Sega Tetris and The Next Tetris: On-Line Edition (both also released for the Dreamcast) are seen as better games as a result.</plot>

    <plot>Tokyo Xtreme Racer, known as Shutoko Battle (Shou Du Gao batoru) in Japan and Tokyo Highway Challenge in Europe, is a racing video game for the Sega Dreamcast. Released in 1999 as one of the console's launch titles, the game was one of the first mission-based racing games. The gameplay involves the player challenging other drivers on the Shuto Expressway in order to gain money to modify and enhance his or her car. The game features a wide variety of Japanese cars and tuning parts to purchase as the player progresses through rivals.[CR]When released in Japan, Shutoko Battle was one of the best selling Dreamcast titles at this time. The game is based on illegal highway racing in Tokyo's Wangan highway with custom tuned cars. A such phenomenon is growing popular in Japan since the 90's with its dedicated manga (Shutoko Battle's biggest inspiration being Wangan Midnight), anime series and video games (C1 Circuit, Wangan Trial, Naniwa Wangan Battle).</plot>

    <plot>A few days after the events described in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Lara Croft is presumed dead. Her close friends begin to recollect her previous adventures, which occurred during different periods of her life. These include searching for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome; preventing the Spear of Destiny from falling into the hands of a ruthless gang leader; facing monsters on the Black Isle of Ireland as a child; and, finally, infiltrating a high-tech complex in pursuit of the Iris artefact. Like its predecessors, Tomb Raider: Chronicles is an action game with puzzle-solving and platforming elements. The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous games, with the addition of a few new skills. Lara can now walk on tightropes, swing on horizontal bars, and somersault forwards from a ledge while crouching. A grappling hook has been added to her inventory. The game also includes a level editor, allowing the player to create new stages for Lara to explore.</plot>

    <plot>Lara Croft faces the great dangers of an unleashed Egyptian god in her fourth tomb raiding adventure. Last Revelation's redesigned inventory system gives Tomb Raider brand-new gameplay. Combined with Lara's new moves and abilities, gameplay features greater scope than ever before. Clear objectives and smaller locations result in less time spent traveling between areas. Individual environments are more reminiscent of the original game - tightly focused and puzzle-orientated, but with higher levels of detail and a greater number of objects than seen before. An emphasis on ancient locations and tombs allows mystery, suspense and characteristic atmosphere to play key roles throughout.</plot>

    <plot>Lara Croft is a Tomb Raider, an archaeologist who explores ancient sites in search of valuable artifacts, who is hired to retrieve an artifact from a tomb in Peru, which turns out to be one of three parts of the Atlantean Scion. Soon betrayed by her employer, Lara Croft travels to Greece, Rome and Egypt to recover the other parts before this powerful device falls into the wrong hands.[CR] _Tomb Raider_ is a 3D action game with platforming and puzzle-solving elements, in which players control Lara Croft from a third-person perspective. The camera follows Lara as she climbs, jumps, and swims through detailed environs overcoming environmental obstacles and deadly fauna. Moving through levels often involves finding spots where Lara can climb, looking for spots where Lara can use her acrobatic ability, and sliding blocks and pushing levers to solve puzzles and open passageways.[CR]Lara is armed with twin pistols with infinite ammunition, but she can pick up higher caliber weapons to take on deadlier human opponents. Lara also comes across restorative health packs and has a compass with which she can orient herself. Lara's opponents include animals, gunmen, as well as primeval and supernatural beings. Careful explorers can also find secret areas and avoid traps.</plot>

    <plot>Lara Croft faces the great dangers of an unleashed Egyptian god in her fourth tomb raiding adventure. Last Revelation's redesigned inventory system gives Tomb Raider brand-new gameplay. Combined with Lara's new moves and abilities, gameplay features greater scope than ever before. Clear objectives and smaller locations result in less time spent traveling between areas. Individual environments are more reminiscent of the original game - tightly focused and puzzle-orientated, but with higher levels of detail and a greater number of objects than seen before. An emphasis on ancient locations and tombs allows mystery, suspense and characteristic atmosphere to play key roles throughout.</plot>

    <plot>A few days after the events described in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Lara Croft is presumed dead. Her close friends begin to recollect her previous adventures, which occurred during different periods of her life. These include searching for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome; preventing the Spear of Destiny from falling into the hands of a ruthless gang leader; facing monsters on the Black Isle of Ireland as a child; and, finally, infiltrating a high-tech complex in pursuit of the Iris artefact. Like its predecessors, Tomb Raider: Chronicles is an action game with puzzle-solving and platforming elements. The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous games, with the addition of a few new skills. Lara can now walk on tightropes, swing on horizontal bars, and somersault forwards from a ledge while crouching. A grappling hook has been added to her inventory. The game also includes a level editor, allowing the player to create new stages for Lara to explore.</plot>

    <plot>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is a skateboarding simulation in which you control a famous skate star around 3D environments. Each game area contains a plethora of objects like ramps, rails, and half-pipes which can be used to perform tricks. Each trick you perform earns you more points for your score.[CR]The game is divided into two types of levels. In the first, you skate around locations like a mall, a city street, or a warehouse. In each of these areas, there are 5 goals to complete. Some goals involve obtaining a high score, others smashing objects, and some collecting objects. For every goal you complete, you earn a video tape. By collecting enough video tapes, you unlock levels and skateboards for you to use. There are 6 levels like this. The second type of level is a competition. You get to make 3 timed runs through a skate park, and attempt to get the highest score possible. If you do well enough, you will beat the scores of the computer controlled skaters and win a medal. There are 3 levels like this.[CR]There are nine real life pro skaters you can choose to play as, including Tony Hawk himself. Each skater has their own signature moves that earn you big points if pulled off successfully.</plot>

    <plot>An island in the sky, Shunkashu Island, is a place of everlasting spring where people live peacefully together with androids and spirits. But recently, snow has started to fall on Shunkashu Island. It must be the work of the Snow Family, but what reason would they have to do such a thing? Spring must return to Shunkashu Island, and for that reason the fight is beginning: The Great Snow War.[CR]Daisessen is a strategy game very similar to the board game classic Battleship. Two players arrange soldiers on a grid, then take turns firing at the other team, attempting to destroy their forces first. The game has a story mode and a 2-player versus mode, and also supported online play.</plot>

    <plot>A unique combination of vertically-scrolling shooters and competitive puzzle games, Twinkle Star Sprites tells the story of the apprentice witch Ran, who searches for the fabled Twinkle Star that is said to grant any wish to the one that finds it. Unfortunately she is not the only one seeking the star, and thus must fight her way and defeat all the other characters that seek the star in shooter duels.[CR]The game plays mostly as a vertically-scrolling shooter, with you controlling your avatar and attempting to shoot and avoid the incoming enemies. The difference in this game is that each player has his own play area, a la Puyo Puyo, and the enemies cause splash damage around themselves when shot. Thus chaining the destruction of several enemies creates a combo that performs an attack move on your opponent. These moves can range from targeted fireballs, to special moves unique to each character, to the summoning of special "boss" characters that the other player must destroy before continuing.[CR]Each player has a lifebar, and as with most shooters there are bombs, and collectible power-ups to be found. The game features an arcade mode in which you can freely select what character you want to control, as well as a 2-player Vs mode and a story mode chronicling Ran's journey.</plot>

Instead of guns, your characters have keyboards strapped to them, and instead of shooting the zombies that constantly jump out at you you'll need to type out the words attached to the zombies in order to kill them before they crack open your head and feast upon the goo inside.

    <year>2006</year>
    <plot>Under Defeat is a shoot 'em up arcade game by G.rev. It was released for the Sega Dreamcast in March 2006. The game takes place in an alternate reality based on World War II, and, in a controversial twist, players control German-speaking characters (under the banner of "the Empire"), fighting against enemies ("the Union") that speak English and possess weapons patterned after those of both real-life Allied and Axis powers (for example, naval units in Level 2 bear heavy resemblance toward the Imperial Japanese warships). The game was released very late in the life of the Dreamcast, but sold much better than expected, probably because there were no other home ports planned in the foreseeable future.[CR]Players assume control of a helicopter, which can be rotated like a more limited version of the mechanism in Zero Gunner 2. Gameplay is largely very traditional, and bears a strong resemblance to some older Toaplan games, especially Twin Cobra. It uses 3D graphics, and a slightly angled perspective to give the game more depth than most other titles in the genre.[CR]On October 27, 2011, G.rev announced a remake titled Under Defeat HD to be released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[1] The game is released by Rising Star Games on February 23, 2012 in Japan, November 9, 2012 in the UK and set to be released on November 28, 2012 in North America for PlayStation 3 only and January 25, 2013 in Europe. The Xbox 360 version for North America was released on August 26, 2014 as a downloadable game-only under Games on Demand. An upgraded version of Under Defeat HD (PS3, Xbox 360) was made on Sega Ring Edge 2 arcade System, named Under Defeat HD+. Now that version is coming to arcades with some improvements via Sega's ALL.NET. Among the enhancements this will have is a horizontal orientation mode, more detail in the battlefield and a "New Order" mode where apparently you can choose from different types of aircraft.</plot>

    <plot>The events of this game take place in the near future. You are cast in the role of a young woman named Kei, a police officer who specializes in counter-terrorist activities. One day she and her boyfriend (also a policeman) receive an assignment to investigate a murder that occurred in a hotel. The investigation gradually leads to a confrontation with a mysterious evil man who seems to know a lot about Kei's past, which was concealed from her...[CR]The game is a third-person shooter with strong elements of survival horror, somewhat similar to Fear Effect games. Kei uses guns in order to dispatch of the enemies. She can side-step and roll to avoid the enemies' attacks. Ammunition and health kits are rare, and there is a possibility to steal them from the enemies. Kei can communicate with the police station by using her cat, which is a disguised communication device.</plot>

    <plot>Unreal Tournament is completely different from Unreal: it is now mainly based on multiplayer, like Quake 3.[CR]At the beginning, you have to play classic deathmatch rounds. After you have successfully won some of them, a new game mode becomes available, domination. In domination there are about three or four different areas scattered around the map to be controlled by your team. For a certain amount of seconds you control one area, a point is added to your score. The more areas you control, the faster your team's score rises. When you or the other team reaches a certain score, the game is over. The third mode is called capture the flag, every team has a flag to defend and tries to capture the other team's flag to score a point.[CR]The fourth game mode is called assault. This mode requires completion of real missions, such as attacking an enemy base and destroying a specific object in it. Again, there are two teams, the defenders and the attackers. You have to complete the mission in a certain time, for example five or ten minutes. If you were successful, your team has to defend this time and the other team attacks. But the attacking team now only has as much time as you needed to attack.[CR]All these modes are either playable in single or multiplayer mode. If playing alone, you have a large menu with orders you can give your bots. Also, all weapons were redesigned, and some new ones are added.</plot>

    <plot>As the 2nd millennium ends, the cities are over-ran with Apocalyptic violence. Is this down to urban frustrations, or a sinister cult controlling everybody? You are either cop D'Arcy Stern or former soldier Roper McIntyre, and have to find the answers, but more importantly put a stop to the carnage. [CR]This involves a succession of action-packed non-linear missions. The environment incorporates shadows, rain, fog and a day/night cycle. Police cars, motorcycles and ambulances must be controlled during some missions. There are many ways to 'settle' the enemies - car chases, hand-to-hand combats and action movie-style shoot outs for example.</plot>

    <plot>Vampire Chronicle For Matching Service is a 2D versus fighting game by Capcom, done in the same style as the classic Street Fighter series. The game uses the CPS-2 system - the same as Street Fighter Alpha series, which makes the gameplay of these two titles very similar.[CR]The game is also an installment in the Darkstalkers franchise, presenting a collection of all eighteen characters and four different play modes available in the series. Like in the previous games, the playable characters are monsters and supernatural creatures, such as vampires, werewolves, demons, zombies and mummies, instead of regular boxers or kung-fu and karate fighters.</plot>

The main difference between Vanishing Point and countless other racers is that you are never racing directly against other cars, but rather are racing against the clock. Your position at the end of the race depends solely on your time, not on your finishing position relative to other cars. What's more, there are loads of computer controlled cars that are there simply to slow you down.</plot>

For those that do not know, the Virtua Fighter series is your classic beat-em-up, with a bunch of characters all trying to kick, punch, throw and body slam the bejesus out of each other. Each of the characters has over a hundred possible moves and the game plays very faithfully to the original. The game features interesting arena to fight in which are more like real locations in they are not flat and some parts can be broken away during the match.</plot>

    <plot>Look out -- Wham! Bam! And a full-body Slam! This Dreamcast version of Sega's revolutionary fighting game packs a one-two-three punch. As one of 12 fierce characters, you have a single deadly goal: to kick some 3D ass 'til you win the World Fighting Tournament. Incredible 3D environments, fluid gameplay, and lifelike graphics enhance the smooth fighting moves you're used to in the mega-hit arcade original. An exclusive feature of the Dreamcast version is Team Battle Mode, in which your custom three-person team goes head-to-head with an opponent's custom team. Virtua Fighter 3tb is so realistic that characters actually watch their opponents' every life-like move, like when they fall forward FROM behind or lose their balance when pushed. Focus your razor-sharp reflexes and take lethal aim as you deliver bone-crunching blows to your reeling opponents. When the dust settles, you'll still be standing.</plot>

    <plot>Directly translated from the popular arcade stand-up, Virtua Tennis offers a light-year jump from the Pong-style tennis of yesteryear. Sporting rich 3-D graphics, crisp animation, and realistic sound effects, you'll swear you're courtside at a grand slam. But, thanks to the game's simple controls, you won't have to spend years at a tennis camp just learning a backhand. The game features hard-top, grass, and clay surfaces, all with distinct ball-bounce and sound responses. Choose one of eight internationally ranked tennis pros and play against advanced computer opponents, or plug an extra controller in and play a friend head to head. Just as in real championships, ball boys, chair umps, and even spectators react to your game.</plot>

    <plot>Kei is a computer engineer. One day he walks into an internet bar. As he is checking his e-mails, he notices an unknown e-mail with an attachment. That takes him to a site called "Cat's Eyes". There he sees a movie of a man being killed. Not giving it a second though, he dismisses that as a game to pass time. Next day, he sees the exact same murder on the TV news.[CR]Most of the game is happening on a fictional OS desktop where you can further access pre-defined set of applications. Web lets you access 18 different web channels with over 150 home pages which contain various things and mini-games, some to move the story forward, some just to create more believable atmosphere. Mail system keeps all the received e-mails notifying you of new ones and those you read, with ability to delete them if you wish. Data application consists of files and movies. It lets you watch all the movies you have seen so far. The remaining applications are more system oriented, config lets you change game configuration (field, speed, sound, and screen), and the file application is used to save or load a savegame file.</plot>

    <plot>This is a fighting parody of the show, called Who Wants to Beat Up a Millionaire? In WWTBUAM, you answer questions and get an opportunity to beat one of five in-game millionaires half to death in order to drain his or her bank account and fill your pockets. The show is hosted by Egregious Phillin, who for all intents and purposes is Regis Philbin, only fatter, louder, and more annoying. The game also has its own clever variation on the show's lifelines, here called Lifeboats.</plot>

    <plot>Worms World Party is an artillery game, which is a type of Turn-based strategy game. Like its predecessors, Worms World Party involves controlling a team of worms and using a collection of weaponry to eliminate the opposing team(s). The worms can walk and jump around and use tools such as the ninja rope and parachute to move to otherwise unreachable locations. The worms have an arsenal of dozens of weapons, ranging from longbows to bazookas and from fireball to Holy Hand Grenades. There are also an array of special weapons, such as Armageddon (meteor shower) or the end-all, be-all Concrete Donkey.</plot>

    <plot>Yukawa Moto Senmu no Otakara Sagashi (or "Former Director Yukawa's Treasure Hunt" as the title translates to) was a promotional game released by Sega where 10,000 applicants could win a prize of Y=10,000 each. To do this the players had to use clues presented on the internet (using the Orange Dreamkey CD for internet access). All that was needed to enter was to purchase the game at certain retailers for the low price of Y=980. The promotional period was between March 20 through April 11, 1999.[CR]In the game the player is cast as Sega's former Senior Managing Director Hidekazu Yukawa, presented as a cartoon character. From a top-down perspective the player navigates between different screens and using a limited amount of digs with a shovel, Yukawa needs to find certain pieces of puzzles (all with a Dreamcast theme) to match the online hints given through the internet via the Dreamcast. If he manages to complete the correct picture, the player was eligible to enter the raffle where the prize money was at stake.[CR]There is also a VMU mini-game included which could be downloaded to aid further in the quest and make digging for treasure faster.</plot>

    <plot>In the near future, scientists working for the powerful Asian conglomerate known as Igem have discovered a new energy source. Refusing to share their technique with the rest of the world, Igem eventually developed a weather control machine named ONI, which they intend to use for the purpose of global domination. A squadron of ace helicopter pilots, called Zero Gunner, is assembled to destroy ONI - but Igem fights back with everything they've got...[CR]Zero Gunner 2 is a top-down shooter. All backdrops and vehicles in this game are modelled in 3D, though the gameplay mostly follows the conventions of 2D shooters. Since your craft is a helicopter, a "target and spin" feature has been added, whereby you can both rotate your craft to attack an enemy more efficiently, or alternatively lock on a particular point in space and rotate around it while still firing. These actions are not automatically executed, and are controlled by the player; in order to succeed, mastering this feature is imperative.[CR]The usual power-ups and boss enemy battles are included in the game, along with a selection of helicopters to choose from.</plot>

Players control "chariots" pulled by mechanical animals either on land, water or in the air while racing against five other players. Two modes are available: a standard "championship" mode in which you simply race around a track, and a "battle" mode which adds weapons into the mix. A split-screen two-player mode is also supported.</plot>

    <plot>deSpiria is an RPG adventure that takes place in the futuristic Japan of 2070. Twenty-two years after the World War III, an organization known as Church has taken power. You play as Allure Valentine, a girl who was recruited by the Church as an undercover agent. On one of her missions, Allure boards a train that crashes shortly thereafter. Her first task will be to find a way out of the underground tunnel and to discover who or what was behind that crash.[CR]The game is a RPG with elements of pure adventure. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective. You fight enemies in turn-based battles, but instead of usual party you have several "minds", a kind of summoned monsters who will fight together with Allure. They will heal or attack the enemy using special "mind attacks" of various elements - love, curse, etc. In adventure mode, you explore the environments by pressing the A button, which will highlight objects you can interact with. The movements are shown as short CG sequences, similar to many Western-style adventures.</plot>
